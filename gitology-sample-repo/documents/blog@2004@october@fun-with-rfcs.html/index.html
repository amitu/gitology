<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>So you have read enough RFCs, and thought they were boring, were they   <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1438.html">RFC-1438-IETF-Statements-of-Boredom</a> boring? Or, oh you think you can parse any mime compliant email message, well can you parse "<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1437.html">electronic mail messages that include entire   sentient life forms, such as human beings</a>" as attachments?  And is your coffee pot <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2324.html">Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)</a> compliant? <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1776.html">This</a> one is my fav: <span style="font-style: italic;">the IPng focused on choosing an addressing scheme that makes it possible to talk to everyone while dispensing with the irrelevant overhead of actually having to say anything</span>. Another gem: enough of voice over IP, can you transmit <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3251.html">electricity over IP</a>? exactly what Reliance should be looking at. :-) <br /><br /> <br />All these and more at <a href="http://marcel.wanda.ch/Fun/RFC">Marcel Waldvogel: Fun with RFCs</a>. They have <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc968.html">poems</a> too!<br /><br /> <br />PS: Request for Comment(RFC) are the draft that goes on and becomes internet standards like HTTP and Internet Email.
