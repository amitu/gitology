<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>BoingBoing is <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/09/blogging_is_good_for.html">pointing</a> to somebody <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/09/blogging_is_good_for.html">saying</a>: blogging is good for career, and states ten reasons:<br /><blockquote>  1.   You have to get noticed to get promoted.<br /> 2.   You have to get noticed to get hired.<br />3. It really impresses people when you say "Oh, I've written about that, just google for XXX and I'm on the top page" or "Oh, just google my name."<br />4. No matter how great you are, your career depends on communicating. The way to get better at anything, including communication, is by practicing. Blogging is good practice.<br /> 5.   Bloggers are better-informed than non-bloggers. Knowing more is a career advantage.<br /> 6.   Knowing more also means you're more likely to hear about interesting jobs coming open.<br /> 7.   Networking is good for your career. Blogging is a good way to meet people.<br />8. If you're an engineer, blogging puts you in intimate contact with a worse-is-better 80/20 success story. Understanding this mode of technology adoption can only help you.<br />9. If you're in marketing, you'll need to understand how its rules are changing as a result of the current whirlwind, which nobody does, but bloggers are at least somewhat less baffled.<br /> 10.   It's a lot harder to fire someone who has a public voice, because it will be noticed.</blockquote><br />I don't know about that, infact I took some time convincing myself that posting that last reason is okay, I mean isn't it like blackmailing your boss? Blogging is a tool, per se not good or bad for anything, its how you use it, almost just like anything else. <br /> <br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
