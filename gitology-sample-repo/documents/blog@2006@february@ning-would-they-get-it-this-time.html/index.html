Let people easily create social applications tailored with difference web services. Allow others to clone those applications and take the code from them directly into whatever they are building instead of building from scratch. Watch everything evolve as better and better stuff gets built, which in turn is used to build even better stuff. Ning leverages the platform by aggregating the applications and selling advertising and premium tools/features. </p></blockquote><p>Which is so wrong. In my previous post <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2005/10/ning-my-thoughts.html">about ning</a>, I said <span style="font-style:italic;">"What good is reusing code if you can not reuse the data?"</span>. Imagine <a href="http://cuteoverload.ning.com/list.php?sort=winner">Whats Cuter</a>; on their winners page they have listed 50 pages of winners, with each page containing 10 results, which means there already have been atleast 500 contests. This is also ning's most popular application, which means I am thinking probably thousands of users are using it already. <br /><br />Now I read <a href="http://www.ning.com">www.ning.com</a> which says step 2 <span style="font-style:italic;">"Follow the Clone this App button to clone and customize your app. It's that easy."</span>, yes it is that easy but if I did it would I get to work with those images that has already been uploaded, those votes that has already been casted? or would I be expecting suddenly those thousands of users will on day one move to my new application and stop using the previous one. When they are saying "clone" what they mean is "fork", and this is what wikipedia has to say about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(open_source)">forking in open source</a>: <br /><blockquote>The term is particularly used in free or open source software, when a schism occurs because of different goals or personality clashes. In a fork of this type, both parties inherit identical intellectual rights but typically only the larger group, or that containing the original architect, will retain the full original name and its associated social capital. Thus there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.</blockquote> </p><p>So they have made "try to kill this project that I like so much" the easiest operation and somehow fooled themselves into thinking it is a good thing. <br /><br />This is the most important thing you should be looking for in the revised ning, if they don't do it this time, they will repeat their previous failure story. </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
