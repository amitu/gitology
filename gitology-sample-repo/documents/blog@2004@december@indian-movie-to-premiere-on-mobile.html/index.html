<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>An upcoming Indian "campus caper" film called 'Rok Sako To Rok Lo' will be the first full-length feature film to premiere on a wireless cellular network. Subscribers to India's Airtel service will get to watch a streaming version on their Edge-capable phones on December 9th, in an attempt to generate buzz for the theater release which will land on the 10th. It's a gimmick, sure, but maybe the idea has legs? A lo-fi version to generate buzz for the hi-fi/high-resolution version that will have a commercial release? Smart bands have done it with their music&#271;&#380;&#733;there is no reason movie studios couldn't do the same thing, unless they were worried that people would have ever more warning they were about to watch opening-weekend dreck.</blockquote></span> <br />Incidentally the movie is directed by a management guru <a href="http://www.arindamchaudhuri.com/">Prof. Arindam Chaudhuri</a>, dean at <a href="http://www.iipm.edu">IIPM</a>, and has a best selling <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/10/23/stories/2003102300890400.htm">book</a> or <a href="http://www.arindamchaudhuri.com/books.htm">two</a> to his name. He intends to <a href="http://www.webindia123.com/news/showdetails.asp?id=47650&amp;cat=Business">corporatize</a> the movie production in India and has previously done a couple of Bangla movies too.
