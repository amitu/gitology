<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Some very intesting comments at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060220-6218.html">ArsTechnica:</a><blockquote> <p> The total cost of Peter Jackson's <i>King Kong</i> was somewhere north of US$200 million. That's quite a bit, but such big-budget blockbusters are rare, and you can make and market a Hollywood movie for well under half that figure. Indeed, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> had a <a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brokebackmountain.htm">production budget of only US$14 million</a>.   </p><p> In the tech industry, the price of a new fab is currently around US$5 billion, a price that puts such facilities out of reach for all but the biggest players like Intel and IBM. Still, that's 25 <i>King Kong</i>s, or over 350 <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>s, or 1,000 five million dollar episodes of a big-budget HBO series like <i>Rome</i> or <i>The Sopranos</i>. My point is that, for even just half the price of a single 65nm fab, the tech industry could buy a few small studios and just start throwing tons of free content at the world. Or, for the full price of a fab, they could fund almost a decade worth of low- and medium-budget content to give away as an inducement for people to buy hardware. </p> <p>Intel, IBM, and other tech companies with large investments in Linux know full well that you can sell a lot of hardware by giving away the software. Why not give away the content too? How many dollars worth of media center, home networking, and home network attached storage hardware could you sell if consumers knew that there were terabytes of free, unencumbered, high-definition, processor-intensive, storage-hungry, bandwidth burning, digital content awaiting them on the Internet&#226;content that they could copy, share, and shuffle around among as many newly purchased media devices as they like? </p></blockquote> </p><p>But there is one serious problem with this, content industry may be very small but not the telecom industry, which is 15 times as big acoording to this article. Hollywood is just the vamp, the real villians are telecom companies.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
