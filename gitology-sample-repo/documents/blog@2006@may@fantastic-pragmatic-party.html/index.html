<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Scott Adams writing about his fantasy <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/05/pragmatic_party.html">political party</a>. Quote:<br /></p><p></p><blockquote><p>As President, I would refer to myself as the Chief Flashlight. I would shine light on whatever the citizens needed to know to form their opinions. I&#8217;d order the government to publish on the Internet continuous debates on all important issues. And I&#8217;d let the proponents of each side manage their sides of the debate. I&#8217;d order a team of independent researchers to attach links to any factual claims so you citizens can see for yourselves who is trying to hoodwink you. Both sides would be free to make any claims they like. But the independent team would always point the reader to the facts. Over time, the compulsive liars would lose all credibility and be pushed aside by their own people.</p> <p>As President, I would rarely take sides on the major issues. My job would be to bring the best arguments on all sides of every issue to the citizens and help them make up their own minds. My administration would make it a top priority to improve how the government communicates with its citizens. And that might require making the information more entertaining or at least easier to digest. As a general rule I would say that if the citizens don&#8217;t understand both sides of all important issues, I have failed as President. If the people need simple charts and graphs, I&#8217;ll provide them. If they need puppet shows, I&#8217;ll stick my hand in a tube sock and hide behind my desk. Whatever it takes.</p></blockquote><p></p>Judiciary throughout the world is based on the basic premise that given same amount of knowledge any one will arrive at the same conclusion. Every single difference in opinion, and thus problem in this world, is just a failure in communication.
