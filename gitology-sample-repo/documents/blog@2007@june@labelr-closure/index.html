This is a very old news for all directly affected. About a year and a half back, I started <a href="http://www.amitu.com/blog/2006/01/introducing-labelr.html">this project</a> to allow category support to blogger hosted blogs. It went well in intial testing, and near the end I had about 300 blogs using it. It was a django powered website, and hosted on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?135689">dreamhost</a>, and for some reason dreamhost was just not reliable enough for this service. One of the specialty of this service was if it goes down, it takes down all those 300 blogs with it. After a series or reported incidents I was forced to shut it down, for lack of any technical solution, as I did not have time and money to get a new hosting service. So here is an apology for all the people using labelr, for its shutting down abruptly. 
</p>
<p>
The culprit here was my stern requirements, "not a minute downtime", especially difficult for shared hosting services. Dreamhost should not really be faulted, as they do not officially support django, and are ideally suited for PHP based and static websites. They are still my favorite for running mediawiki and keeping backups [they give huge amount of space] and are really cheap. There support staff is usually good, so please do not look at this take down as to indicate too badly on them.

Off late I am using <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/shared_hosting?affiliate=vakow">webfaction</a> for hosting my blog, and other django applications. They are really seamless to start, I had the website running in less than 20 minutes since I got the account activated, including all learning, configuration etc. They give you your own instance of http, which is really cool. Trac is much easier to install with webfaction than dreamhost for example. If you are looking for a place to host django website, I highly recomment webfaction, for mediawiki, enormous amount of disk to archieve all your mails, or for running wordpress/mediawiki, go for dreamhost [they have the best backup solution I have seen implemented, <a href="http://blog.dreamhosters.com/kbase/index.cgi?area=2585">snapshots</a>].

I intend to release the source code of labelr, but its right now in terrible shape, may be I will write a few articles about the specific things worth taking away from that work.

<p>
So dear labelr users, sorry for the shutdown, and thanks for the enormous amount of support and interest I recieved from you guys, I still have more than thousand unread labelr beta request in my mail box.
