<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across this interesting <a href="http://sanskrit.gde.to/learning_tools/learning_tools.html">site</a> with lots of material about learning sanskrit. They have an interesting <a href="http://sanskrit.gde.to/learning_tutorial_wikner/wikner.pdf">tutorial</a> for example, and reading it you get a good understanding why people call sanskrit a "scientific" language and all that. They also have a really <a href="http://sanskrit.gde.to/allfilelistpdf.html">huge collection</a> of sanskrit texts if you already know sanskrit and are looking for something to read on the web.
