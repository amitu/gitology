What you also know that cops and legal officials can call up that information, but what you don&#8217;t know is that now this information is available for sale on the web for a couple of hundred dollars, thanks to sites like Locatecell.com. The ease with which this information is available, has sent FBI and others in a tizzy. </p> <p><a target="_new" href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-privacy05.html">Chicago Sun-Times</a> reports that FBI is worried that agents can be compromised, just like their snitches. The potential for wide-scale abuse is not only imaginable, but quite possible. <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em> doesn&#8217;t really talk about how the information ends up with sites like Locatecell.com. Why aren&#8217;t the cell phone companies doing something to make sure that this information doesn&#8217;t leak out? I mean shutting down the supply is the best way to prevent this from happening. <em>Anyone have more knowledge about this, please post a comment!</em></p></blockquote><p>BTW I have heard quite a few stories about how easy it is to read SMSs from/to perticular cellphone for call center employess in Mumbai. Hopefully incidences like this will highlight the importance of privacy. If you have data, it is only a matter of few Rs.10/- CD for it to spread out, if you care about it, you will stop people from recording data in the first place, and if you won't you will see some major event that will shock you when you would realize you were stupid not to.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
