<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote><p>You know when geeks think they&#8217;re <strong>multitasking</strong> in front of the computer? Heck, I often think I do. Realistically speaking I&#8217;m not... I only do one thing after another, no matter how many windows I have opened.</p> <p>It&#8217;s like this: whenever I upload something to my server, or download a big file from somewhere, <strong>I&#8217;m switching to another task</strong>... say, photoshopping a picture. While theoretically this saves time (when you program too much, you hard-wire &#8220;optimization&#8221; into your brain!), I&#8217;ll mostly end up dabbling with the other task far longer than the download will take... so basically, I&#8217;m getting back to the old task after 30 minutes, even though the download only took 5 minutes.</p> <p>At my last job (one big open room, a phone on every desk!), after a while I made it a rule to <strong>never do more than two tasks at the same time</strong>, no matter how smallish the third or fourth task would appear. &#8217;Cause here&#8217;s what happens if you &#8220;multitask.&#8221; Say, you&#8217;re programming something on site A. Then the manager comes along and wants you to upload site B (maybe your team agreed on putting up a red flag on the desk if you&#8217;re busy, but your manager retains the right to overrule the flag with &#8220;ASAP&#8221; tasks).<br />Soon thereafter an Outlook alert pops up. Oh, it&#8217;s just one of those office joke mails &#8211; but if you don&#8217;t read them you&#8217;ll send around the same joke a month later, and everybody flames you. So you quickly glance through the mail, and then you notice the attachment doesn&#8217;t load properly. You end up walking over to your sysadmin, who has a problem with a script at that moment. So you help him with the script, but you don&#8217;t know the answer, so the two of you google for a bit. You find a page in the results which isn&#8217;t necessary what you were looking for but it seems interesting, so you... OK, you get the point.</p> <p><em>Do you still remember the original task I was talking of?</em> Right, site A... it didn&#8217;t progress at all for the last hour. And that upload for site B was finished since, well, you don&#8217;t really know, and you&#8217;re not even sure you uploaded the necessary 12 files, or just 11, because just when you started the upload, your manager came along.</p> <p>No, this ain&#8217;t multitasking... that&#8217;s chaintasking. And it&#8217;s almost useless, though it may make us feel like we&#8217;re achieving more. What really happens is that we&#8217;re downsizing our attention frames &#8211; proud to have achieved 20 tasks that day, we might have only gotten around to do <em>one or two</em> properly.</p></blockquote></p><p>On <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-05-09-n82.html">Google Blogscpoed</a>.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
