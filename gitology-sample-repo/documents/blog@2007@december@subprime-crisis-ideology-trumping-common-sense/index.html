<p>An <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/opinion/21krugman.html" target="_blank">editorial</a> about it in NYTimes. This is my problem with isms, they are good starting points, they are good guides, but the moment they start getting precedence over &quot;this makes sense taking every thing known into account&quot;-ism, they become part of the problem rather than the solution. </p><p>PS: Good thing NYTimes has dropped their paywall. &nbsp;</p>
