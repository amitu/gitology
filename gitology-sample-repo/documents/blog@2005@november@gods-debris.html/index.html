Imagine that he explains for you the great mysteries of life&#8212;quantum physics, evolution, God, gravity, light, psychic phenomenon, and probability&#8212;in a way so simple, so novel, and so compelling that it all fits together and makes perfect sense. What does it feel like to suddenly understand everything? <i>God's Debris</i> isn&#8217;t the final answer to the Big Questions. But it might be the most compelling vision of reality you will ever read. The thought experiment is this: Try to figure out what&#8217;s wrong with the old man&#8217;s explanation of reality. Share the book with your smart friends then discuss it later while enjoying a beverage. </blockquote></p><p><a href="http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/godsdebris/">Very thought provoking book</a> by Scott Adams.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
