<p>After using Blogger for years, finally moved to home brewed blogging system in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/overview/">django</a>.  The biggest challenge was to make sure all links keep on working, and data migration. <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/documentation.html" >BeautifulSoup</a> is your friend, if you are thinking of getting data from arbitrary services. </p>
<p>Lots left to do, <s>archive page is giving some problems</s>, comments are not there yet, <s>feed is not working still</s>; but am glad to be back to blogging.</p>
