<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote> <p>Ever play a game of chess and your opponent makes a move and you realize the game is over? Nothing dramatic like taking your queen, just a simple strategic move where, after you look at it for a second you think "oh-oh," and from that moment on you're basically just looking for your opponent to make a mistake because otherwise they're obviously going to win. </p><img src="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/images/playforsure.gif" align="right" /><p>Well, I've been watching Microsoft's moves over the past few weeks and I can pretty much say that it's game over for a lot of Microsoft competitors, though they may not realize it yet. To me the decisive move was their <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050105/sfw117_1.html">MSN Video</a> announcement which included deals with MTV as well as TiVo to make sure that TiVo To Go recordings play on Microsoft Mobile devices. That's when I saw the big picture: Microsoft's DRM strategy and Windows Media WMA codec are going to allow them to have a massive advantage in the consumer electronics market, which includes everything from MP3 players, to mobile phones to your set-top box, to a host of other converged devices. </p> <p> Obviously, I'm mostly concerned about the mobile phone area, so it's come as a real shock to me the integration and forsight that Microsoft has applied to this area when it comes to music and video. Very soon anything you're able to record on your TiVo will be playable on your Windows Mobile device, the new <a href="http://www.msnvideodownloads.com/">MSN Video Downloads</a> service (among others) will allow you to see television and movies, and the variety of integrated music stores will allow you to buy and play music. There's no competitor to this breadth of mobile media offerings right now or that I can see in the near future.</p> </blockquote> </p><p>Read the rest of Russ's rather depressing commentry on his <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008231.html">blog</a>.
