<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Rashmi has another <a href="http://youthcurry.blogspot.com/2006/05/karan-vs-arjun.html">post on reservations</a>. But she makes a mistake. [Please read that <a href="http://youthcurry.blogspot.com/2006/05/karan-vs-arjun.html">post</a> before proceeding.] Her entire argument rests on numbers, and that too not even hers, they are by some TV interviewer:<br /><blockquote><em>The NSSO 1999, which is the most recent of the NSSO studies available, conclusively shows that the share of SCs, STs and OBCs in employment is <span style="font-weight: bold;">exactly</span> proportional to their share of the population.</em></blockquote>[Which were probably quoted from <a href="http://www.ibnlive.com/news/devils-advocate-kamal-nath/10443-4.html">this place</a>.] The figures that compelled me to write my <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2006/05/defending-reservations.html">last post about reservations</a> seems to say something different:<br /><center> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upadhyay/147001610/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/52/147001610_f32ad80cfd_m.jpg" alt="impact of reservation" height="180" width="240" /></a></center>SC/ST represent 28%  of the population, and represent (104.5/353.5)=29% of total labour, (4.5/36.3=)12.4% of educated labour and (1.4/12.9=)10.9% in good jobs. Corresponding figures for OBC(Hindus): 32%(27), 33.7%(26), 23.4%(58) and 18%(64). So yes, probably in terms of total labour, the percentages are equal, but only an ignorant will say that OBCs and SC/ST are represented properly in terms of employment.</p><p>Looks like the devils advocate does not know that the devil is in detail.</p><p>PS: Karan Thapar would have been kicked out of a real court for his clearly <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ambush-defence">ambush defence tactic</a>.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
