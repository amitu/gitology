<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote><p>Windws XP SP2 introduces a few new twists to <a class="term1" href="javascript://" what="" is="" ip="" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/terms_popup.php?seek=^TCP/IP$','terms','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=300')" title="What is TCP/IP ?">TCP/IP</a> in order to babysit users and "reduce the threat" of worms spreading fast without control. In one such attempt, the devs seem to have limited the number of possible TCP connection attempts per second to 10 (from unlimited in SP1). This argumentative feature can possibly affect server and <a class="term1" href="javascript://" what="" is="" p2p="" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/terms_popup.php?seek=^P2P$','terms','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=300')" title="What is P2P ?">P2P</a> programs that need to open many outbound connections at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Rant:</strong> The forward thinking of Microsoft developers here is that you can only infect 10 new systems per second via <a class="term1" href="javascript://" what="" is="" ip="" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/terms_popup.php?seek=^TCP/IP$','terms','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=300')" title="What is TCP/IP ?">TCP/IP</a> ?!?... If you also consider that each of those infected computers will infect 10 others at the same rate:<br />second 1:  1+10 computers<br />second 2: 10+10*10 computers (110 new ones)<br />second 3: 10+100*10 computers ( 1110 new ones)<br />second 4: 10+1000*10 computers (11110 new ones)<br />....<br />all the way to <strong>10*60 + 10^60 computers in a single minute</strong> (that's a number with 60 digits, or it would far exceed Earth's population). Even if we consider that 90% of those computers are unreachable/protected, one would still reach ALL of them within a minute.</p> In other words, even though it is not going to stop <a class="term1" href="javascript://" what="" is="" worm="" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/terms_popup.php?seek=^WORM$','terms','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=300')" title="What is worm ?">worm</a> spreading, it's going to delay it a few seconds, limit possible network congestion a bit, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">limit the use of your PC to 10 connection attempts per second in the process !</span> </blockquote></p><p><a href="http://www.speedguide.net/read_articles.php?id=1497">Link</a>.
