<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>The <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/index.asp">MIT Technology Review</a> has some very detailed <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/01/issue/ferguson0105.asp">analysis</a> of Google and its future. According to me they are missing the point, despite all my aversions I have become quite a frequent blogger, and Google's <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> is offering the best blog service. Initially they had paid features, but it is now completely free, contrast it with Microsoft's <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/">Spaces</a>, which even their paid <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">PR blogger</a> couldn't <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/12/02.html#a8788">recommend</a>. Then take Google's <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a>, a very popular site in the social network I belong, it has all the things you might need from a service like this, no ads, no spam mails. Or take <a href="http://www.picasa.com/picasa/">Picasa</a>, Google's photo organizer, I would rate it as one of the best and coolest I have seen so far, so much so it made me want to buy a digicam just so that I get something to organize using it. Or <a href="http://www.hello.com/">Hello</a>, a companion to Picasa, kind of an instant messenger integrated with photo viewer and blogger. Just download these software and see the kind of coolness and ease of use they have, they do what you expect them to and stay out of your way, and this I can say for all the services offered by Google I mentioned here.
<br /> <br />It is always tempting to remember Netscape and think would Google go that way as if it were a product, what it really is a provably smart group of people with great insight into the mind of customers, and an ability to deliver. That can't go down so easily.
<br /> <br />PS: Wishing Google will purchase <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a> soon.
