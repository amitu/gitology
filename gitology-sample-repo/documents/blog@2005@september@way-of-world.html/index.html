The band posted a response on their official forum <a href="http://forums1.sonymusic.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/716102313/m/5201067064">apologizing for the protection</a> and detailing ways to circumvent the protection and rip their songs to PC.  Switchfoot linked to open-source program CDex's <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/downloads.php">download</a> page with instructions on disabling the autorunning protection and ripping the files to MP3. Many of Switchfoot's fans have been upset by the copy protection measures, and it's nice to know the artists seem to care about the issue."</blockquote><i></i>be <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=162654&amp;cid=13594249">evil</a>:<br /><span style="font-size:100%;color:#000000;"> <a name="13594249"><b></b></a></span><blockquote><span style="font-size:100%;color:#000000;"><a name="13594249"><b>Evil?</b></a> (Score:5, Interesting)     </span> <br />by <a href="http://slashdot.org/%7EKingOfGod">KingOfGod (884633)</a> <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/zoo.pl?op=check&amp;type=friend&amp;uid=884633"><img src="http://images.slashdot.org/neutral.gif" alt="Alter Relationship" title="Alter Relationship" border="0" style="border:0px none; padding: 0px;" /></a> <<a href="mailto:ldrada%40gmail.%20c%20o%20m">ldrada@gmail. c o m</a>>     on Monday September 19, @04:18AM (<a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=162654&amp;cid=13594249">#13594249</a>)     <span style="font-size:-1;">(Last Journal: <a href="http://slashdot.org/%7EKingOfGod/journal/">Tuesday May 17, @09:37AM</a>)</span> <br /> <br />So, let me get this straight.<br />The record labels ARE the bad guys, and the band themselves probably didnt have a say when their record label decided that the CD should have copy protection, right?<br />The artists did realize that by putting copyright-protection on their CD, the piracy of their CD would increase, and not decrease - like the record company propagates - because everyone wants to listen to their music not just on their CD player, but also on their mp3 player, car stereo, and whatnot, right?<br /> <br />I really salute these guys for doing that they did, by putting out these instructions. It doesnt even matter to me that this smells a bit like a PR stunt - The thing that matters is that maybe more artists will follow this example, and soon "UNPROTECTED AUDIO-CD" will be a treat, just like "Limited Edition" is today.</blockquote></p><p>PR: <a href="http://orwell.ru/">The most powerful force of the universe</a>.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
