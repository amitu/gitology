What they do is: </p><ul> <li>Store all your data on the huge iPod hard disks</li> <li>Boot any (x86) PC using iPod as extern USB harddisk</li> <li>Run Knoppix</li> <li>Run VMWare</li> <li>Run WinXP in VMWare</li> </ul><p>What you get in effect is your complete favourite operating system, all the programs and settings, as well as all your data, in you iPod, and accessible from any PC within minutes. Between this and solutions like <a href="https://www.foldershare.com/">FolderShare</a> most of the sharing data/settings on multiple computer related problems can be solved.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
