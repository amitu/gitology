And a standard around that that notifies you that something has changed called RSS.
<br /> <br />This is a very interesting thing, because whenever you want to send e-mail you always have to sit there and think who do I copy on this. There might be people who might be interested in it or might feel like if it gets forwarded to them they'll wonder why I didn't put their name on it. But, then again, I don't want to interrupt them or make them think this is some deeply profound thing that I'm saying, but they might want to know. And so, you have a tough time deciding how broadly to send it out.
<br /> <br />Then again, if you just put information on a Web site, then people don't know to come visit that Web site, and it's very painful to keep visiting somebody's Web site and it never changes. It's very typical that a lot of the Web sites you go to that are personal in nature just eventually go completely stale and you waste time looking at it.
<br /> <br />And so, what blogging and these notifications are about is that you make it very easy to write something that you can think of, like an e-mail, but it goes up onto a Web site. And then people who care about that get a little notification. And so, for example, if you care about dozens of people whenever they write about a certain topic, you can have that notification come into your Inbox and it will be in a different folder and so only when you're interested in browsing about that topic do you go in and follow those, and it doesn't interfere with your normal Inbox.</blockquote></span> <p> From <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2004/05-20CEOSummit.asp">one</a> of the Bill Gates <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches.asp">speeches</a>. </p> <p> Via <a href="http://steverubel.typepad.com/micropersuasion/2004/05/pearl_harbor_ii.html">Micro Persuasion</a>. </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
