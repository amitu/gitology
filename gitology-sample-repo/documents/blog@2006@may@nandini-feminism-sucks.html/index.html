<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>She is talking about <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/index">thefword</a>:</p><blockquote><i><a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2006/02/pretending_that_men_arent_grownups">The Rape Article</a></i><br /><br />So. Drunk girl does the bonkity-bonk with drunk guy at a party, then wakes up in the morning and cries rape. Guy says it was consensual. Girl doesn't really remember much of anything that happened that night. (I guess her entire case consists of "I'd never willingly sleep with that guy no matter how drunk I was - look how ugly!") Anyway, the judge dismisses the case, and the prosecutor is quoted as saying "drunken consent is still consent", and making remarks to the effect of, "women are adults, and must bear responsibility for their own actions". Meanwhile, the guy is getting back to his life, trying to come to terms with being the butt of his friends' jokes for ever and ever and evermore. ("I'll bet she wouldn't even remember you <i>bonked</i> her if she hadn't woken up naked next to you, eh, Jimmy boy?")<br /><br />Ellery, the Modern Feminist, is pissed. Oh looky, the big MCP prosecutor guy with his curling moustache and offensive Italian suit (because Italians are all misogynists, of course). He's blaming the victim! (er, victim of <i>what</i>?) How about suggesting the <i>men</i> take responsibility, too, huh? How about we tell <i>everyone</i> never to drink too much, huh? The guy was equally to blame! (er, <i>for what</i>?) <i>Where's the equal treatment?</i><br /></blockquote><p><a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com/2006/05/feminism-sucks.html">The rest</a>.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
