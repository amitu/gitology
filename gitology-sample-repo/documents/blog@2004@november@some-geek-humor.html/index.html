<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Some funny compiler error messages: 
<br /> <br />These are some of the error messages produced by Apple's MPW C compiler. These are all real.
<br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"String literal too long (I let you have 512 characters, that's 3 more than ANSI said I should)"
<br /></span> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"...And the lord said, 'lo, there shall only be case or default labels inside a switch statement'"
<br /></span> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"a typedef name was a complete surprise to me at this point in your program"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"'Volatile' and 'Register' are not miscible"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"You can't modify a constant, float upstream, win an argument with the IRS, or satisfy this compiler"
<br /></span> <br /><span class="fullpost">"This struct already has a perfectly good definition"
<br /> <br />"type in (cast) must be scalar; ANSI 3.3.4; page 39, lines 10-11 (I know you don't care, I'm just trying to annoy you)"
<br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"Can't cast a void type to type void (because the ANSI spec. says so, that's why)"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"Huh ?"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"can't go mucking with a 'void *'"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"we already did this function"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"This label is the target of a goto from outside of the block containing this label AND this block has an automatic variable with an initializer AND your window wasn't wide enough to read this whole error message"
<br /></span> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"Call me paranoid but finding '/*' inside this comment makes me suspicious"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"Too many errors on one line (make fewer)"</span> <br /> <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"Symbol table full - fatal heap error; please go buy a RAM upgrade from your local Apple dealer"</span> <br /> <br />PS: Bonus link for reading till the end: <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/crazy.html">link</a>. :-)
