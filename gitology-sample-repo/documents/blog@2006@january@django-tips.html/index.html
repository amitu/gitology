<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Here are a few bits I discovered while using <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> in my projects of late:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/authentication/">Authentication</a> framework documentation does not mention whats happening behind the scene. To log in a user you can set <span style="font-family:courier new;">request.session[users.SESSION_KEY]</span> to <span style="font-family:courier new;">user_id</span> of the user. To logout, delete <span style="font-family:courier new;">users.SESSION_KEY</span> from <span style="font-family:courier new;">request.session</span>. They should mention this in their documentation.</li><li>If you find <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/authentication/#the-login-required-decorator">login_required</a> decorator enough for your needs, but do not like the /accounts/login/ url, you can edit django/views/auth/login.py and set them what you want. They should make it configurable through setting.py</li><li><span style="font-family: courier new;">login_required</span> is convenient but <span style="font-family: courier new;">django.views.auth.login</span> lacking , if you modify the "/accounts/login/" line as discussed above, to some of your view own you can avoid <span style="font-family: courier new;">django.views.auth.login</span> views.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2005/sep/24/newshortcuts/">render_to_response documentation</a>, well actually this is just a blog post entry and not supposed to be updated as and when required, and they don't mention what is it in the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial4/">tutorial</a> when they are using it, nor in the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/">right place where they should</a>. Anyways, when using render_to_response I could not find how to user <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/#subclassing-context-djangocontext">DjangoContext</a>, and giving up such nice shortcut just because of this was a bit sad. Well it so happens that it is supported, use something like <span style="font-family:courier new;">render_to_response('template', context_instance=DjangoContext(request))</span></li><li><span style="font-family:courier new;">get_absolute_url</span> <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model_api/#model-methods">model method</a>: well the only documented use of this method is in the admin UI, but admin prefers to ignore it, and uses some redirects instead. Well actually they do not ignore it, and redirect takes you to the right place, but for that to work you will have put <span style="font-family:courier new;">(r'^r/', include('django.conf.urls.shortcut')),</span> in your URLConf. Not documented.<br /></li><li>But this may not solve all your problems with admin site taking you to the right place when you click on "<span class="q">View on Site" in admin. You will have to make sure the sites model contains the right site, which includes the domain name and port number, but without http:// part. Not documented.<br /></span></li><li><span class="q">One of the first thing that comes to your mind when you read django's authentication framework, is wow its cool, but what if I need more fields than they <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/authentication/#fields">support</a>? Well given I just leared the super cool <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model_api/">model framework</a>, I am tempted to create a model and define a <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model_api/#one-to-one-relationships">one-to-one relationship</a> on it with User. Well bad idea. For some reason this won't work, and the preferred way to do such extensions is </span><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/models/subclassing/">Subclassing models</a>.</li></ul><p>Best django tip other than "use django, it is cool" would be: join mailing lists, esp <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers">django-developers</a>, people are very friendly there, and you get prompt help.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
