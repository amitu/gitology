<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> is a stealth mode startup, like <a href="http://www.webaroo.com/">that little one</a> that is going to change the world, launched today, by Marc Andressen, the Netscape fame, and many other smart brains as <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/10/04/ning-the-real-24-hour-laundry/">Om says</a>.<br /><br />First of all there is no Web 2.0-ness about it that we have come to associate with GMail and all those AJAX websites, its very web 1.0, plain old PHP programs fetching data, wrapping HTML around them and producing usual applications, what it has achieved is:<br /><ul><li>sharing the authentication, one login works against all ning applications, same users in the comments etc.<br /></li><li>sharing data, atleast at meta level, something they call <a href="http://www.ning.com/pivot">pivot</a>, you can see the latest bookmarks as well as latest photo uploaded on the same page. You may not care about that, if its for the world, but you go one level deeper and you have all bookmarks, restraunt/movie/book review and photos uploaded by a user, and that may be a good thing.</li><li>sharing the code, you like an application and want to change it in a way that suits you or your locality/company/group? You can do it in as few as a couple of clicks, once you have beta account, which I still don't :-(<br /></li></ul>Sharing. Sharing. Sharing. And we all know sharing is good. :-)<br /><br />If you are developing an application, you won't have to worry about user registrations, about writing code for tagging, which somehow is so cool these days, you won't have to worry about data repository, they have done it all for you, all you do is define what data[object] you are going to store, and for each object, how it "looks", how you change its state, and be done with it, everything else taken care of by ning. So far so good.<br /><br />So what have they done wrong, or rather terrible, which drastically reduces its impact: <span style="font-style: italic;">they have associated data with applications</span>. A very bad idea, data belongs to users, its social software. What good is reusing code if you can not reuse the data? This would lead to artificial segregation of: users, a very valuable commodity to, well any social software. Would you care if someone creates a flickr2 if you can not see your photos already there with lets say the improved UI that flickr2 promised? Would you download your 600 photos and upload it again to flickr2? And would you do the same when flickr3 comes around? The whole sharing idea goes into drain.<br /><br />Users, and then user data is the most important thing in social software, whereas ning decided its users, followed by code!<br /><br />If I had my way I would add an option of "view schema" along with "<a href="http://www.ning.com/about-view-source.html">view source</a>" and "<a href="http://www.ning.com/about-cloning.html">clone application</a>". Indentify schema's by GUIDs instead of names would solve the schema namespace problem. What is schema namespace problem? something I defined, let me explain: lets say all those applications work on types of objects, restraunt review application has objects restraunt and object review, reviews or restraunts can be added or deleted, they have to be displayed etc. Now review is a common word and a lot of applications will have review like object, a review of a movie for example is also a review. If data is not associated with applications, it would be difficult to say if an object of type review is actually a restraunt review or a movie review and we would have to call them RestrauntReview and MovieReview. But MovieReview name may conflict with Flash MovieReview which some "rate your favourite flash movie" application may have used. This is what I call schema namespace problem that would suddenly become a big issue if data is not associated with applications but are global. Solution for this problem is calling each object with GUIDs and not names, and using local aliases for GUIDs to object. GUIDs are gobally unique names, so there is no clash, but they are cumbersome to use, difficult to remember, so each application can define alises for the schemas.<br /><br />Now if things were like this, and I had to clone a superhit flickr like application hosted on ning, I would go to "view schema" for that application, get the GUID and the schema detail for all data types defined or used by this application, then either clone the application if I am interested in reusing their source or write one from scratch but using the same schema GUIDs. Now schema is fixed at the time of definition so I can not corrupt the data stored for someother application, and photos uploaded to my new shiney flickr2 would be accessible via both new and old applications.<br /><br />So far so good again, but there is a very strong criticism against this idea: the old application might have done lots of validation of the data and made specific assumption about it to work reliably, and this may break the old application, what if the new application applies a "smart" url rewriting and rewrites all urls in all the objects and due to a bug in it, even the old applications stops working?<br /><br />Make data readonly from other application? It makes importing data easier, but data is still not shared.<br /><br />Data changeable only via user actions? Thats easy to implement, ning knows who data belongs to and who is the currently logged in user. Would it help? Its akin to user filesystem available to all applications, and only applications that know what they are doing, and thus are sure would not corrupt userdata, would touch that data, and users will touch only the applications that they trust. Though this brings the scary picture of ming viruses and worms, there are many things that makes it not as bad. For example, each ning application may have a review section where users can read other users opinion about it, and some stats for each application like how often it has been used. Also ning can do something more: it knows what all applications are accessing shared data and all application administrator can evaluate each application they are sharing data with and blocklist them, data still belongs to users, but users will get this blocklist warning and may refuse to use them. Also ning may then offer them to create hidden profiles so that they can keep two seperate sets of data with same schema that each application may use. This could work. </p><p>Ning, are you listening?</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
