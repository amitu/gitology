<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Google has silently switched from <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> to <a href="http://www.answers.com/">answers.com</a> as providers of the definitions of query words (that appear among the search result numbers and time summary at top right of Google's search results pages.). The <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/copyright.jsp">list</a> of sources the answers.com searches is much more exhaustive [includes <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=wikipedia">wikipedia</a> for example], and results much more <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=google">meaningful</a>, and are in the same page. Also answers.com gives the pronunciation service free, where as dictionary.com used to charge for it.
