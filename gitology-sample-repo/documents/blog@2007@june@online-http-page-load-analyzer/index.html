Came across this handy <A href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/?url=http://www.amitu.com/blog/&treeview=0&column=objectID&order=1&type=0">tool to analyze page load times online</a>. It gives you nice colored display of all the components of a page, and the time it took to load them. So far I used to rely on a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3371">firefox extension</a> for the same, which is probably more accurate, but this sure is convenient.
