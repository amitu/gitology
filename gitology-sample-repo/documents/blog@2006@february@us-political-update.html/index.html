<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote><div class="item-body-container"><div id=""> <ins class="item-body"><div> <p>I ran into <a target="_new" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts02062006.html">this</a>  article from conservative <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Craig_Roberts">Paul  Craig Roberts</a>.  Despite the growing excuses, I believe it  spells out a few interesting bits.   </p><blockquote> <p>Americans have forgotten what it takes to remain  free. Instead, every ideology, every group is determined to  use government to advance its agenda. As the government's  power grows, the people are eclipsed.    </p><p>We have reached a point where the Bush administration is determined to  totally eclipse the people. Bewitched by neoconservatives and lustful  for power, the Bush administration and the Republican Party are  aligning themselves firmly against the American people. Their first  victims, of course, were the true conservatives. Having eliminated  internal opposition, the Bush administration is now using blackmail  obtained through illegal spying on American citizens to silence the  media and the opposition party.    </p><p>[...]   </p><p>Before flinching at my assertion of blackmail, ask yourself  why President Bush refuses to obey the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act. The purpose of the FISA court is to ensure  that administrations do not spy for partisan political  reasons. The warrant requirement is to ensure that a panel of  independent federal judges hears a legitimate reason for the  spying, thus protecting a president from the temptation to  abuse the powers of government. <b>The only reason for the  Bush administration to evade the court is that the Bush  administration had no legitimate reasons for its spying. This  should be obvious even to a naif.</b> </p><p>The years of illegal spying have given the Bush  administration power over the media and the  opposition. Journalists and Democratic politicians don't want  to have their adulterous affairs broadcast over television or  to see their favorite online porn sites revealed in headlines  in the local press with their names attached. <b>Only people  willing to risk such disclosures can stand up for the country.</b> </p></blockquote> <p>(Emphasis added)   </p><p>In particular I like his point about the no-fly list.  It  always felt dumb to have the no-fly list in the first place  and all of the side effects we have heard from it are the  result of this dumbness.  Maybe it was naivete on my part, but  this makes sense:   </p><blockquote>   Consider the no-fly list. This list has no purpose whatsoever  but to harass and disrupt the livelihoods of Bush's  critics. If a known terrorist were to show up at check-in, he  would be arrested and taken into custody, not told that he  could not fly. What sense does it make to tell someone who is  not subject to arrest and who has cleared screening that he or  she cannot fly? How is this person any more dangerous than any  other passenger?   </blockquote> <p>This is priceless:   </p><blockquote> <b>If Senator Ted Kennedy, a famous senator with two martyred  brothers, can be put on a no-fly list, as he was for several  weeks, anyone can be put on the list</b>. The list has no  accountability. People on the list cannot even find out why  they are on the list. There is no recourse, no procedure for  correcting mistakes.   <p>I am certain that there are more Bush critics on the list  than there are terrorists. According to reports, the <b>list  now comprises 80,000 names! This number must greatly dwarf  the total number of terrorists in the world and certainly the  number of known terrorists.</b> </p></blockquote> <p>He has a follow up article, on the State of The Union,  focusing in particular on the economy bits <a target="_new" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts02012006.html">here</a>.   </p><p>On that note, Bilmes and Stiglitz <a target="_new" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0117-20.htm">claim</a>  that the actual cost of the Iraq war will end up being between  one and two trillion dollars.   </p><p>In the meantime there is a Sundance short that makes fun at  the actual state of the economy.  I found it entertaining, but  it might not be appreciated by everyone (sorry, requires an  updated Flash): <a target="_new" href="http://festival.sundance.org/2006/watch/film.aspx?which=402&amp;category=DOC">here</a>.   </p><p><b>Update: </b> Robert's second article goes well with the  previous video link:   </p><blockquote> <p>[...] The US trade deficit in ATP now exceeds the US  surplus in Intellectual Property licenses and fees. The US no  longer earns enough from high tech to cover any part of its  import bill for oil, autos, or clothing.  </p></blockquote> <p>This is an astonishing development. The US "superpower" is  dependent on China for advanced technology products and is  dependent on Asia to finance its massive deficits and foreign  wars. In view of the rapid collapse of US economic potential,  my prediction in January 2004 that the US would be a third  world economy in 20 years was optimistic. Another five years  like the last, and little will be left.    </p></div></ins> </div></div></blockquote></p><p>By <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Feb-13.html">Miguel de Icaza</a>.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
