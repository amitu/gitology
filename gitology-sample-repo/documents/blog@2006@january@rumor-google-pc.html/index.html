<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Everyone hates Microsoft Windows, and it seems Google is planning to do something about it at the upcoming CES, reports <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/cotown/la-fi-predict1jan01,1,3550761.story?coll=la-headlines-business-enter">LATimes</a>: </p><blockquote>&#8220;Google will unveil its own low-price personal computer or other device that connects to the Internet.<br /><br />Sources say Google has been in negotiations with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., among other retailers, to sell a Google PC. The machine would run an operating system created by Google, not Microsoft&#8217;s Windows, which is one reason it would be so cheap &#8212; perhaps as little as a couple of hundred dollars. (...)<br /><br />Larry Page (...) will give a keynote address Friday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Analysts suspect that Page will use the opportunity either to show off a Google computing device or announce a partnership with a big retailer to sell such a machine.&#8221;</blockquote><p>So it begins.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
