Well, it appears that China really doesn't like people naming their kids after internet related things. Not only is the "@" out, but <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39182933,00.htm">so is naming your kid with a .com</a>. A father wanted to name his son Zhao.com, but the registry office has rejected the name. Perhaps he should have just gone straight to a domain registrar instead. Of course, here in the US we have no such restrictions, leading to things like <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20040202/0019249_F.shtml">kids named 2.0</a>.</blockquote>and:

Avoiding code like "if (table.columns(8).row(12) = 772) ..." is generally regarded as a best practice. But I'm not sure <b>Matt's</b> colleague, however, grasped that concept too well ... </p> <blockquote> <pre>use constant ONE => 1; </pre> </blockquote> <p>Found in a perl header file, Matt was curious and explored to see where it was used...</p> <pre>  my $db_status = $q->param( $constants->STATUS );
