<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Imagine:</p><blockquote>You're standing up on stage in front of a thousand people who  have come to watch you talk.  The house dims, and the bright glare of stage  lighting burns down on you.  Nervous, with sweaty palms and shaking hands,  you prepare to start your presentation.  What will the audience think of  you?  Will they like what you have to say?  Have you prepared enough?   Did you expect a larger audience?  Smaller?  Oh geez, I hope the demos  work... <p> Many of us have been there... up on stage, getting ready to present a PowerPoint  deck.  Or maybe in an important meeting with clients or potential  supporters  of your big idea.  You're probably presenting on a laptop with a TrackPoint  or a TrackPad.  These mouse substitutes are hard enough to use with great  precision in general; when nervous, they can be almost impossible to use.</p> <p> All of these thoughts are going through your head, your hands are shaking, it's  tough enough to use a TrackPad anyway... and PowerPoint makes you click a tiny  12x12 button in the lower-left hand corner of the screen to start the  presentation.  </p> <p> This is one of the only buttons in Office people regularly use under high  stress, and it's arguably the smallest, hardest to click button on the screen.</p> <p align="center"><img src="http://www.sunflowerhead.com/msimages/TinyIcon-12-6-2005.png" /><br /><i>The Start Slide Show icon is so small that it can be tricky to click...</i></p> <p> How many times have I watched nervous people fumble to hit the Start Slide Show  button?  I know I've done it myself many times.  When I'm on the spot  and people are waiting on me, I want the software to make me look good--not add  to my stress by starting me out on the wrong foot.</p></blockquote> <p> Again <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/12/06/500512.aspx">at</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/default.aspx">Jensen Harris: An Office User Interface Blog</a>, how well Microsoft uses they screwups to promote themselves:</p><p></p><blockquote><p> So, the simple Office 12 feature is this: the Ribbon in PowerPoint contains  large, easy to click buttons that make it easy to start your slide show from the  beginning or from a slide in the middle of the deck.  Each of the buttons  is thousands of pixels in size, easy to hit even with imprecise pointers, such as a TrackPoint or a  Tablet PC stylus.</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://www.sunflowerhead.com/msimages/SlideShow-12-6-2005.png"> <img src="http://www.sunflowerhead.com/msimages/SlideShow-12-6-2005_thumb.png" /></a><br /><i>An easy-to-click way to start your presentation (Click to view full picture)</i></p></blockquote> <p>Makes you wonder what is the aversion against using keyboard shortcuts at Microsoft, every new application that Google launches these days comes with a:</p><p></p><blockquote>  Keyboard shortcuts: <b>j</b> - next, <b>k</b> - prev,  <b>n</b> - scan down, <b>p</b> - scan up, <b>enter</b> - select,  <b>r</b> - refresh, <b>s</b> - star, <b>v</b> - show original <a href="http://www.google.com/help/faq_reader.html#keyboard" id="more-keys-help" target="_blank">more >></a></blockquote><p></p><p>at the bottom of the page, and its a much better, more talked about/hyped improvement than <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2005/12/interesting-office-12-ui-innovation.html">Ribbon</a>.
