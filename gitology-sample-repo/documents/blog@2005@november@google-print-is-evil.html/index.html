<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Just came across <a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com/2005/11/worse-than-suspected.html">this</a> at <a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com/">Nandini's Niche</a>:<br /><blockquote>...In essence, Google is making entire books searchable and available online.<br /><br />Wanna see it in action? This is <a href="http://print.google.com/print?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22dissociative+fugue%22">my search for "dissociative fugue"</a> on Google Print. There are 659 results, and the first page, at least, is all good, solid information. I read five pages in 20 books, I'm an expert. I could pass exams without ever paying a single cent for a text book.<br /><br />Am I the only person who sees the glaring problems with this? Right now, information found on the internet is on the internet with the explicit permission of the people who wrote it up, people who have been compensate to their satisfaction for their time and effort. The information that you and I are able to access online is not stolen content, unless, it's an illegal download. Now, if I want, I'll be able to search for relevant passages in textbooks and technical papers and nonfiction books to look up any specific bit of information that I need. I will be able to print it out. I will never need to buy another nonfiction book again.<br /><br />All this, without the permission of the creators of the content I am freely accessing, without them being compensated a penny for it.<br /><br />So don't reassure me that these 'snippets' will be good advertisement, that it will benefit publishers and writers. Let the publishers and writers be the judge of that. Let them <i>opt in</i> to this program if they so wish. Don't force your so-called benefits on them if they don't want it, don't make them go through the trouble of <i>opting out manually</i> if they don't want to be included in your shameless rights-grab. </blockquote></p><p>The best arguments I have seen against Google Print.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
