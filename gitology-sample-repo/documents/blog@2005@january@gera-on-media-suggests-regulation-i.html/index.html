<br /><blockquote>Sad, but true. Look around you. Whatever happened to the Telgi Stamp Paper Scam, or the Hawala Scandal? Or even the issue of the plight of the Indian hockey team? And the papers are filled with pages and pages of "page 3" material, and cricket analysis which dvelve deep into the type to soil on the pitch and the weight of Sachin's bat. The "dollar vote" argument is indeed true. The media will produce what the people are willing to pay for. Simple market economics. But then this very argument is the strongest case for regulation of the media, to an extent. The media is at least as crucial, if not more, than any of the other three modern "estates". Are we willing to "outsource" the legislature to a "free market", non-elected, non-answerable, lowest-bid corporation? I hope we're not. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The media has a responsibility. And if the free market pressures do not allow the media to fulfill that, then the free market has to go.</span> <br /></blockquote> <br />And concludes with:
<br /><blockquote>I'm all for the freedom of thought and expression, and the derived freedom of the press. I should be able to say what I want to, or raise any issue that I feel the need to, but there has to be *some* direction. Otherwise, we'll end up as a country where the North does not know the South, and the East goes the opposite to the West. Some people argue that this has already started to happen. We'll all become "page 3" junkies, where the ambitions of kids would not be to "become a doctor to help the poor", but to become "miss India". But how would the regulation happen? How do we keep the regulation itself in check, so as to not encroach upon the freedom of the press to raise real issues? One possible answer is to have smaller media entities. "Media houses" and cartels should be dissovled, or atleast regulated. The extent of regulation should depend on how big the media conglomerate is. This has obvious problems too. Infact, me or you cannot think up of a solution. Neither can anyone else. The public has to decide collectively. And it is no one other than the media itself which can initiate and carry this public debate. Another <em>Catch-22</em>.</blockquote> <br />In my opinion, he is not far from right, he has identified an issue, media is our eyes, and no one can think all is well with them in India, but he is not quite right either as regulation can not, will not and should not happen to solve that problem. My personal opinion on the state of media is, for some reason its highly depersonalised, we never see any person behind a news, the news reader has no personality. We don't have <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200411/s1250213.htm">celebrated</a> news anchors, we don't have our <a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/king.larry.html">Larry King</a>s. And that is the silver bullet, the "dollar vote" has not been casted yet [who would think media people are making hoardes of money, they are just surviving], and the best part is it does not require any social revolution or govt. regulation, free market itself has all the incentives to inspire budding journalists (bloggers?) and infrastructure to support the talented ones. We have seen some <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/varsha.htm">flickers</a>, and I am sure its only a matter of time.
