I am a huge fan of django. And after their recent <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/UnicodeBranch">unicode improvements</a>, they have become really good option of i18n enabled sites, or sites that are available in multiple languages. So now the interface can be in more than one language, django will select the default website language based on browser settings, and allows user to select their language preferences if they want. Only missing piece was translating data. While django's translation utilities support translating data in database, but something was missing, the capability to for example, store description of a book, for example, in different languages. <A href="http://code.google.com/p/i18ndynamic/">i18ndynamic</a> is exactly what was needed.
