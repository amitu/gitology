<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/29/0223253&amp;from=rss">this interesting discussion on slashdot</a>. It asks the question if we are living in 1984. This comment was rather interesting.<br /><div class="commentTop"> <div class="title"> <h4><a name="15804376"></a></h4></div></div><blockquote><div class="commentTop"> <div class="details"><h4><a name="15804376">Dissenters need to stop calling Bush a moron</a></h4> <span class="score"></span>by <a href="http://slashdot.org/%7Eben+there...">ben there...

Bush does not live on a ranch. That is all an image.<br /><br />Morons don't continuously expand their Presidential powers, while ignoring (breaking) hundreds of laws designed to limit their power. You haven't read this Boston Globe article:<br /><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/" title="boston.com">Bush challenges hundreds of laws</a> [boston.com]?<br /><br /><blockquote><div>President Bush has quietly claimed the authority to disobey more than 750 laws enacted since he took office, asserting that he has the power to set aside any statute passed by Congress when it conflicts with his interpretation of the Constitution.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Legal scholars say the scope and aggression of Bush's assertions that he can bypass laws represent a concerted effort to expand his power at the expense of Congress, upsetting the balance between the branches of government. The Constitution is clear in assigning to Congress the power to write the laws and to the president a duty ''to take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Bush, however, has repeatedly declared that he does not need to ''execute" a law he believes is unconstitutional.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Bush is the first president in modern history who has never vetoed a bill, giving Congress no chance to override his judgments. Instead, he has signed every bill that reached his desk, often inviting the legislation's sponsors to signing ceremonies at which he lavishes praise upon their work.<br /><br />Then, after the media and the lawmakers have left the White House, Bush quietly files ''signing statements" -- official documents in which a president lays out his legal interpretation of a bill for the federal bureaucracy to follow when implementing the new law. The statements are recorded in the federal register.<br /><br />In his signing statements, Bush has repeatedly asserted that the Constitution gives him the right to ignore numerous sections of the bills -- sometimes including provisions that were the subject of negotiations with Congress in order to get lawmakers to pass the bill. He has appended such statements to more than one of every 10 bills he has signed.</div></blockquote>Bush knows exactly what he's doing. Calling him a moron is simply underestimating his gross disrespect for your freedoms and the Constitution, and is a distraction from his intent to give himself more and more power while taking away your rights.</div></div></blockquote><div class="commentBody"><div id="comment_body_15804376"></div> </div>The question much worthy of consideration "Can they do it?" than "Are they doing it?". I think we can answer the first question in yes. Lets see what we give to our children.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
