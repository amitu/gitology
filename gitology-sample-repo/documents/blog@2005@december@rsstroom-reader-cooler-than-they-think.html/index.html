The 'rsstroom reader' is a bathroom gadget that prints news feeds onto your T-P - that's right, your TOILET PAPER! The best part is the "biometrics" toilet seat that'll figure out who you are based on your weight and prints the news you want - not your roommates tabloid garbage. Going to the rsstroom will never be boring again!</blockquote></p><p>RSS dispensing machine would be another similar application. Infact <a href="http://alerts.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! RSS Alert</a> should consider putting such printed rss feeds dispensing machines in waiting rooms and restraunt and malls. They know where you are getting the printout from, they know what kind of stuff you are interested in based on the content of your feed: targeted local ads in a mall, every advertisers dream! Advertisers can make it free too! Give you a Smart Card for authentication. Super cool!</p><p>Found it <a href="http://www.djspyhunter.com/teapot/2005/12/rsstroom-reader-toilet-paper-printer.html">here</a> via <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/08/1749258&amp;from=rss">/.</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
