<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>I recently got a recommendation to use <a href="http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote.html">KeyNote</a>. I have previously worked on [the development of] a note talking application called <a href="http://knowit.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html">KnowIt</a> by Michal<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> R., for KDE. Though KnowIt is functional to the level of being useful in day to day life, but KeyNote is much closer to what I desired it to be. The real killer feature is the one click access to it, you are working on any application, just press the shortcut [mine is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl-Shift-.</span>] and it appears instantly, put down your thoughts/whatever, and press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Escape</span>, and its gone. No taskbar, no systray, no waste of any real estate. The notes are organized in multiple tabs, and within each tab you can then create a tree:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/keynote.PNG"><img src="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/keynote.PNG" width="100%" style="border: 0px none ;" align="middle" /><br /></a><br />The default configuration is slightly heavy, you will have to disable a couple of toolbars from the View menu to make it look a little unintimating, but the UI and the application as a whole is extreamly configurable with lots of interesting <a href="http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote_features.html">features</a> [support for strong encryption, configurable format for inserting date/time, configurable "formats", automatic capture of clipboard content, complete customization of eack keyboard shortcut, plugin system, special macro system, spellchecker, (external) dictionary , hyperlinking across notes, virtual notes to view/edit external file as a subnote, glossary/configurable text expansion, templates, rot13 etc etc comes packed with extensive documentation, go explore!] hidden in deep corners for the 133t users, in the true spirit of an <a href="http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote_os.html">open source project</a>.<br /><br />Get it <a href="http://www.tranglos.com/free/files/kntsetup.exe">here</a>. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
