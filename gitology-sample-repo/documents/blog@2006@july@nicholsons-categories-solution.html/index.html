<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p><a href="http://da.vidnicholson.com/">This fellow</a> dropped by, telling about his <a href="http://da.vidnicholson.com/2006/07/very-easy-blogger-categories.html">solution</a> to blogger's lack of category problem.  Smart. Not as integrated as <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2006/01/introducing-labelr.html">labelr</a>, but definetly much easier to "install". We seem to think alike, dude, you ever visit India, I will buy you a drink. :-)</p><br />I have a few suggestions for you:<br /><ul><li>You use transparent images, which means your server will be hit by n+1 times for each page load, where n is the number of categories for that post page, you can change this to 1, by a "post ping", let javascript come, let it come with information about the categories assigned to this page, known by your server, and let the javascript find a discrepency between that and what the current page says, notify the server if there is difference.</li><li>Use &lt;div class="category"&gt;Name of the Category&lt;/div&gt; to assign categories to a post instead of &lt;img src=""&gt;s, this way they can appear at the bottom of the post, which is more "traditional", and in you javascript find all instances of divs of class category, and convert it to links, which when clicked will do the same thing that you do in the sidebar. </li></ul><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
