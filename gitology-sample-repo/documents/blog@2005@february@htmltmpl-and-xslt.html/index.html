<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>The traditional approach of cgi programming or Dynamic HTML generation, intimately mixes the program aspect of it written in programming languages like Perl, PHP or Python with the presentation aspect in the form of HTML. A PHP/Python programmer is a bad HTML designer and vise versa, and a separation is required. I knew this since very long but not exactly how to do it, but finally came across two approaches to the separation: htmltmpl (<a href="http://htmltmpl.sourceforge.net/python.html#example-simple">hello world example</a>) and XSLT (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_transformation.asp">hello world example</a>) [both rely on some kind of templatization, HTML designer produces the templates, while programmer provides data to fill in the template]. Later is ofcourse superior as its a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">webstandard</a>, would be supported by nearly every programming framework if not already, and data is cleanly separated from both data churner and date presenter, but the downside is it has steeper learning curve and requires learning lots of mumbo jumbo like XML, <a href="http://www.xmlfiles.com/xsl/xsl_intro.asp">XSL</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_intro.asp">XPath</a> and XSLT, while former may be much easier to get to speed with. One or other must be used for generating all the (dynamic) HTML content on the web.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
