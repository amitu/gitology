<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>From their <a href="http://www.nvu.com/">site</a>: <blockquote>Finally! A complete Web Authoring System for Linux Desktop users as well as Microsoft Windows and Macintosh users to rival programs like <span class="veryStrongEmphasis">FrontPage</span> and <span class="veryStrongEmphasis">Dreamweaver</span>.   <p><strong>Nvu</strong> (pronounced N-view, for a "new view") makes managing a web site a snap.  Now <span class="veryStrongEmphasis">anyone</span> can create web pages and manage a website with no technical expertise or knowledge of HTML.</p> </blockquote><br />Have been getting requests for recommendation about WYSWYG HTML editor for Linux, and <a href="http://quanta.sourceforge.net/main2.php?snapfile=snap01">Quanta</a> did not really cut it, now we have Nvu. Good thing about Nvu [pronounced NView for New View] is its based on Moziall composer [meaning slightly better rendering than Quanta's Konqueror], and is cross platform. They have plans to get it integrated with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla Suite</a>, and <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a> is behind them. I perticularly liked their CSS editor. Get it <a href="http://www.nvu.com/download.html">here</a>. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
