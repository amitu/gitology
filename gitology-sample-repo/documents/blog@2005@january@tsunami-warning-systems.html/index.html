<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>There have been a lot of <a href="http://sify.com/news/scienceandmedicine/fullstory.php?id=13642979">talks</a> lately about <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/jan/03tsunami1.htm"></a>tsunami early warning systems, and how it could have saved lots of lives, but the <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/1/1/143719/1930">problem</a> is:
<br /><span style=";font-family:verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:85%;"><blockquote>Prior to the December 2004 tsunamis there wasn't a pressing need for one.  The <a href="http://geology.about.com/library/bl/bltsunamideathtable.htm">deadliest tsunami</a> on the Indian Ocean was one that killed 1,543 on the Arabian Sea in 1819. More recently tsunamis had struck India in 1988 and 1998 killing 3 and 2, respectively. Defending the costs of deploying a system before December 2004 would have been difficult. In the Pacific, tsunamis are frequent and many lives were lost in many incidents before the <a href="http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/issues/emergencies/tsunamis/tsunami.htm">tsunami warning   system</a> was established. Tsunami hazards also exist in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean, Caribbean and Black Seas but no systems have been developed there either.
<br /> <br /></blockquote></span>It seems they have plans for one such <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/jan/03tsunami1.htm">mammoth</a> warning system, what we might be missing is:
<br /><span style=";font-family:verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:85%;"><blockquote>The <a href="http://www.prh.noaa.gov/ptwc/">Pacific Tsunami Warning   Center</a> in Hawaii knew about the earthquake almost immediately and issued a safety bulletin to its 26 member countries, but there was confusion about who to contact beyond the organization.
<br /> <br /></blockquote></span>Get it, hundreds of thousands died not because people did not know about the tsunami, but because they did not know who to contact. That's the real problem, the number of <a href="http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20050102_tsunami.htm">natural disasters waiting to happen</a> is not small, and K.P.S. Gill may be right when he <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/Jul11Amar.htm">said</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">"one of the astute maxims of military history is that generals are            always fighting the last war"</span>.
