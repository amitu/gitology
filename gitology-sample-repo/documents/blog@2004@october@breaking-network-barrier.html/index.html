<br /><blockquote> <span style="font-style: italic;">KDE is, by design, a fully networked desktop. Network files are accessible as readily and easily as local files from most applications.
<br /> <br />The integrated networking layer is certainly one of the strongest points of innovation in KDE. Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X have a long way to go to catch up with the robust, transparent functionality that KDE has provided since version 2.0.
<br /></span></blockquote> <br />Despite being technologically ahead of others, its a quite old feature in KDE, and like tabbed browsing in browsers, one may have to use it for sometime to really see the advantages. Read the KDE's <a href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/kdeqt/kde3arch/nettransparency.html">architecture document</a> to understand how it works.
