<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Just came across <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/google-in-china.html">Google's official statement</a> on China Censorship, and this I would consider the PR blunder of the decade. This is the the first two paragraphs:</p><blockquote>Google users in China today struggle with a service that, to be blunt, isn't very good. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google.com</a> appears to be down around 10% of the time. Even when users can reach it, the website is slow, and sometimes produces results that when clicked on, stall out the user's browser. Our <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> service is never available; <a href="http://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;q=">Google Images</a> is accessible only half the time. At Google we work hard to create a great experience for our users, and the level of service we've been able to provide in China is not something we're proud of.<br /><br />This problem could only be resolved by creating a local presence, and this week we did so, by launching <a href="http://google.cn/">Google.cn</a>, our website for the People's Republic of China. In order to do so, we have agreed to remove certain sensitive information from our search results. We know that many people are upset about this decision, and frankly, we understand their point of view. This wasn't an easy choice, but in the end, we believe the course of action we've chosen will prove to be the right one.</blockquote><p>Lets look at the fact: Google claims to do it because their services were slow or down for upto 10% of the time. Now its totally easy to understand that Google has such high quality requirements that this is not acceptable, but if they say this is the their only problem, then they should highlight very clearly that Google is such great company that 10% downtime is not acceptable to them. Their next sentence should have been:</p><blockquote> This bad quality of service is due to censorship imposed by Chinese Govt. who is trying to limit access to politically sensitive information. Now we understand that about 93.45% of our usage is not about politically significant matter, and is about matters of science and technology, something that we strongly believe citizens of emerging countries like China should have access to. Considering all this, smart brains at Google, that we managed to preserve after an alian spaceship crash at Google Headquarters sometime in 1998, decide the following: we will create a www.google.cn which will conform to China's censorship, but do not worry, as our stats tell us only (100-93.45 = )6.55% of queries results will be affected by this censorship, in return the youths of China will get unabated access to Google archieves and search results. And we also promise, once again, www.google.com search results will be uncensored going with our spirit. Chinese citizens are welcome to use it if they think their query is not suitable for www.google.cn, although the quality will not be as great as we would like to, due to factors beyond our control. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Let me reiterate we are not hiding any information from them, we are just making a smaller subset of inforation more readily available.</span><br /><br />Some will say this is a slippery slope, and acceding to one country's demand will force us to do the same for other country, to which all we can say, maybe, but this is one fifth of population we are talking about, and if for their progress we have to dilute the Google brand that we have worked so hard to create, and love so much, its a sacrifice worth making. Atleast we would know we listened to our hearts, and we did our level best.</blockquote><p>How could they screw up so bad!</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
