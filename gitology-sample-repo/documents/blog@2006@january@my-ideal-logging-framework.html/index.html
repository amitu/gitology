<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>I am an agressive logger, which is all the more important for dynamic languages like python, where there is minimal code sanity checking by interpreter. By agressive I mean I have a <span style="font-style:italic;">logging.info("entering function foo, with arguments "blah" of type &lt;str&gt;")</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">logging.info("exiting function foo with return value ..")</span> at beginning and each end point of most functions I write. Obviously this is going to become tedious, and python decorator are the best thing to do such, but they make the logging extreamly verbose. A good log viewer might be of help for filtering this log is a must. Just came across <a href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html#debug-with-the-print-statement">debug with print statement</a> section of py.test, and that could be a great idea, since logging is very verbose, do not print anything, but when an "interesting event" occurs, print all logs generated in that function call. Which beings us to what is an interesting event? One obvious candidate is exceptions, we all know they are bad, but we can borrow ideas from <a href="http://www.ilowe.net/software/typecheck/">typecheck</a>, and define a failure by typecheck as another interesting event. [Though typecheck has no provision for acceptable exceptions, a support for typecheck.exceptions() would be good too.]</p><p>This can in one go give all all the advantage of strict typed languages, but unlike them, we do not force anything to you, just report when things go out of "normal". This can make programming python even more fun. The reason typecheck should be coupled with logging decorator is because it can become tedious to use too many decorators otherwise.</p><p>self.todo++</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
