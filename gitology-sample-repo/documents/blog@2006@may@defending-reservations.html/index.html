<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Note: I am "upper caste" [as much as I hate this title] and any mention of "we" refers to them.<br /><br />There is a <a href="http://news.google.co.in/news?hl=en&amp;hs=Luh&amp;amp;amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;ct=title&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=reservation&amp;btnG=Search+News">huge furor</a> going on in India these days over the newly propsed reservation in India. For visitors outside India, this issue is so intense that it lead to hundreads of students burning themselves in protest against it about 10 years ago. <a href="http://chaturvedi.blogspot.com/2006/05/what-next.html">Namit has written some thing about it that you should read</a>.<br /><br />The people who burnt themselves and Namit is wrong. We should support reservations.<br /><br /><center> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upadhyay/147001610/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/52/147001610_f32ad80cfd_m.jpg" alt="impact of reservation" height="180" width="240" /></a></center><br />Here is why: 234 million out of 998 million Indians are the "forward" category that is not getting reservations, this is about 24%. If goventment decided to open 100 schools, 75 of which are in the area which covers 75 percent of the population, would it be unfair on the rest of the 25%? How is it different from reservation. 75% population deciding government should give them 75% share in all allotments it has say over, is only democratic.<br /><br />Now the core issue: "lower caste" people are deprived. They are a lot in numbers. And they <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/">hate upper caste</a>. And they hate <a href="http://www.onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_603.shtml">Gandhi</a>. This hate, which is what is being channeled has been conspeciously missing in all the whole debate. Politicians reconize this hatredness, they fuel it, and reap the benefits in votes. Politicans are not the cause, they are the affect.<br /><br />We keep on saying education is what makes people think strainght, and yet never question our assumption that all those economically backward classes of society are making sound judgement about who is responsible for their misery. We think that they know that we are not responsible for their misery and that that they know their only problem is uneducation. They do not know that. We may take long to educate them in general, but we can educate them about the fact that we are not the reason of their misery much more easily. We can do that by ending this enviorenment of hate. We have to offer the olive branch of reservation, that alone will convince them that we are sincere.<br /><br />A lot of people burnt themselves, because they mistenly fell for the "minority" reservation name that is used for it. People think that "minorities" are getting disprotionate reservation in schools. The problem is they are not "minority" despite being called so. This confusion is the main reason for the angst of "majority" hindus. We are equally "uneducated". We hate them for this reason. We hate them for being the reason for our percieved loss in opportunities.<br /><br />This is a classic case of divide and rule. We hate them. They hate us. We fight over who would get bigger share of 100 seats when we combined should be fighting to get our deserved 1000 seats. Politicians are screwing us, not by alloting us smaller share, but by making us think counting shares is what the real issue is about.<br /><br />Let us not ask who gets how much, lets ask if the total we are getting combined is enough? Does governemt need to spend more on education? Is it the funds that are stopping those extra schools or ineffeciency [and corruption] of fund allotment? Let us take the fight to them. </p><p>Lets take reservation as an opportunity to make friends.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
