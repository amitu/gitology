<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> at Boing-Boing has some explaination on why <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/24/why_some_piracy_can_.html">DRMs are doomed</a> to fail:<blockquote>...if I want to download a song instead of buying it, then all I require is a search tool and a copy of that song that someone, somewhere has cracked. It doesn't matter how strong or weak the DRM is on the copy that I choose <em>not to buy</em> -- all that matters is how much resource one cracker, somewhere in the world, was willing to devote to breaking the DRM. The <em>first</em> copy may be very expensive, but <em>all subsequent copies are free</em>. <p> The only way that DRM could stop me from downloading is if:  </p> <ul> <li> Every copy of the song circulated, from the recording studio to the record store, had strong DRM on it  </li><li> No analog to digital converters were available to anyone, anywhere in world, who might have an interest in breaking the DRM (since you can just avoid the DRM by making taking the analog output off the player and re-digitizing the song in an open format) </li><li> Peer-to-peer networks ceased to exist  </li><li> Search engines ceased to index file-sharing sites  </li><li> No "small worlds" file-sharing tools were in circulation  </li> </ul>     Unless all of the above are true, then the amount of DRM on a song is irrelevant to how hard or easy it is to get a copy without DRM on it.</blockquote> </p><p>The reason I consider DRM bad is: to make DRM work, the above list becomes the check list of things that must to be done, and leaving first item aside for a moment ["strong DRM" is as mythical as it gets without strong DMCA type laws], every other item is a good thing for us, and any progress in stopping them would be bad.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
