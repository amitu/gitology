<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://chaturvedi.blogspot.com/2006/04/callous-indifference-virus-strain.html">Namit is furious at the "indifference" of Indian consulate in Armenia</a> over the death of some Indian student who was denied basic first aid, and dean apparently stopped others from helping him out. <a href="http://chaturvedi.blogspot.com/2006/04/trying-to-reach-out.html">Read more here</a>. This reminded me of an essay Ayesha was writing, and hasn't finished due to her exams:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-weight:bold;">Indifference versus incompetence</span><br /><br />A lot of people are accusing our past & current governments of indifference to the plight of common man. Consider the plight of religious victims, the delay in investigations and trials thereafter which seem to never end and not even a handful of convictions to those who killed numerous and more importantly murdered India. I don't think it's entirely fair. Moreover, I don't think it's useful.<br /><br />It comes back to the same old razor: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence." And it becomes clearer with every passing day that incompetence is more than adequate to explain our government's inability to react quickly enough to circumstances across our country. <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">"Indifference" is a charge that defies empirical data, because we can never truly know the hearts of others. "Incompetence," however, can be quantified: So let's keep our eye on the ball. There's no benefit to anyone by getting personal, and by claiming that "the government doesn't care about poor people or is dead set against a particular religion." It's much more useful to make it crystal clear that the government has been just plain negligent, and that their negligence led directly to the deaths of thousands of people -- because a negligent government is something that, with enough support, we can change. </span><br /><br />Incompetent journalists, criminally negligent journalists or liars who are complicit in the mass deception of the Indian people; there are no other ways whatsoever to describe the men and women who comprise the news institutions of India. From the hired face you see every day on the CNN's of India and aaj tak to the journalism interns. Every person currently employed in the corporate   media today has some soul searching to do.<br /><br />The members of today's news media warrant outrage from the people of the world who have fallen victim to their despicable practices. With each new day brings new crimes while a false sense of reality is passed to Indian people via our media. In olden times when street justice was the norm we would be dragging our beloved anchormen and women into the streets and having a public execution, for these people have been the empowering force behind the most despicable and<br />dangerous Indian administration in history.<br /><br />NOTE: I use this word: Lie. Not mislead, not mistake, misspoke, neglected to inform, omitted, left out, misrepresent, factually incorrect etc. Part of the definition of a lie is to leave a false impression. These people lie to us. <br /><br />I (we) should be angry. There has been too much writing and discussion about the state of the media. The good people who are trying to address the problems with the media have been dignified, intellectualized, soft spokened and IGNORED. IT IS TIME TO GET LOUD! It is time to get angry! It is time to stop the madness! With dignity and fairness the media critics and watchdogs tried to alert the public of the information being withheld by our news media. Dignified and standard methods of communication can not defeat the hugeness of false reality that emanates from our TVs, and news papers. <br /><br />With dignity Media wrote about many events. They did their own investigations, held hearings and they exposed the complicity of our ruling government and its administration in those events. They wrote with dignity until their fingers hurt. They spoke with dignity until their voices gave out. They filmed documentaries until they ran out of film. They were ignored, suppressed, murdered in the literal sense. The Congress administration has devastated this nation and the world. Everything that is Indian is being destroyed while the media continue to sell catch phrases and concepts to public like "democracy" and "security"; empty words that in most cases have described the opposite of what is actually taking place. This is the stuff that ignites revolutions! Where are all the revolutionaries? Where is the outrage? Where is the anger? From the environmental terrorism and no way that our government is sensitive to this topic and failure of the dignified commissions to bring about any major changes this in itself will kill more people than all terrorist combined have issues like these go unmentioned by the media. The fact is that the not many Indian public can believe there is a reality other than the one presented on their television, news papers and radios. This, in essence, gives the broadcast media the power to control perceived reality. They abuse this power.<br /><br />In response to this article the Government supporters are going to talk about the liberal media and they will sarcastically start to bring up menacing entities that control the media. I don't care who controls the media. It is a secondary issue. As long as you know that the deception is taking place you can counter it. As long as you know that there is a pickpocket in the crowd you can protect yourself. It is a bonus if you can identify him/her. It is a double bonus if you can<br />arrest and convict him/her. Suffice to know you are being lied to. Protect yourself Get angry.<br />One thing that we do know is who is lying to us. They splash their names all over your life. They lied about virtually every aspect of the Mau Attacks (just for your information Mau is a very small town some where in UP where over 100s  of Hindus literally got butchered by Muslim fanatics who entered the trains and killed almost all the passengers) and I am sure lots of people would try to justify this as an act done by media to avert greater harm or probably media<br />was ordered to do so by our very prestigious government . But what about our right to know, what<br />about solace to the victims and their families and what about their unanswered sense of vengeance or the most required pressure on judiciary and our lethargic police system to wake up and find these gruesome murderers who are roaming free in our society, our government which promises us safety and media which can ensure this, are betraying us on our face, isn't this outrageous.<br /><br />Enough is enough!<br /><br />I am asking you to get angry. Get furious. When you turn on your TV and find that the top story<br />is one that you used to have to read about in a supermarket tabloid, ask yourself what news is NOT being reported. Then try to figure out how the on screen pretend journalist keeps a straight face as they try to pretend that a domestic crime is national news and worth deep thoughtful journalistic discussion.<br /><br />We have to educate the public about the people who lie to them every day. You should be furious. You should feel rage. You should do something. At least spread the word!</blockquote> </p><p>Emphasis mine.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
