<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>After struggling for hours to get the caption and border for my previous post working, am falling in love with CSS. This <a href="http://codepunk.hardwar.org.uk/acss.htm">page</a> helped me in getting started, this one is a more <a href="http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/stylesheets/advancedcss.html">advanced tutorial</a>, and here is a good <a href="http://www.westciv.com/style_master/academy/css_tutorial/index.html">reference</a>. BTW IE seems to be much more tolerant in handling bad CSS than Firefox, so do test on Firefox to make sure it working right everywhere.
