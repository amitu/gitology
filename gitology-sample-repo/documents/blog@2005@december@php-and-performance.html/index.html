<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Sometime back I wrote in <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2005/10/phps-peardb-performance-sucks.html">PHPs PEAR::DB Performance Sucks</a>:</p> <blockquote>There is an order of magnitude performance drop, not just 0.02 percent, DB.php, as nice it is, and I am sure its being worked on, but as it is, it should not be recommended for any serious application.<br /></blockquote> <p>This I later realized was not a good test, as someone commented out just now on the post. <a href="http://eaccelerator.net/HomeUk">eAccelerator</a> was the answer I was looking for, <span style="font-style: italic;">it increases performance of PHP scripts by caching them in compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated.</span> So yes the tests I did were accurate, and without caching, not only PEAR::DB, whole PHP's performance is pretty bad. On each request, the PHP script is looked up, parsed, and executed, and parsing is a major overhead if the size of script is significant. The problem is none of the tutorials or documentation I have read talk about this significant fact, maybe they just assume that everyone knows about it, or consider it as a part of PHP standard installtion. The performace boost is very significant, upto 400% in my installtion/application, and eAccelerator or any other script caching should be considered for all PHP installtions.  </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
