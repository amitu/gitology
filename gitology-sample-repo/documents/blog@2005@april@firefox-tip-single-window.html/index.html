<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>One of the common problems with <a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/sessionsaver">session saver  extension</a> is during closing the window, for example after installing/updating extensions, if we close the "main window" with 20 odd tabs opened and then realize there was another window open, thanks to lets save opening an attachment in gmail for example, the whole session is lost, as session saver will save the session when the last window is closed. One solution is to force all those <a href="http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/linking/_A_TARGET_95y98y108y97y110y107y.html">target="_blank"</a> links to open a new tab in the current window instead of a new one. Here is how to do it:<br /><ul> <li>Go to <a href="about:config">about:config</a>, by typing this in location bar.</li> <li>Put "browser.tabs" in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</span> at the top.<br /></li> <li>Double click on browser.tabs.showSingleWindowModePrefs if its "value" is False and it is not displayed in bold.</li> <li>Now from Tools Menu, click on Option, and go to Advanced Tab.</li> </ul><center><img src="http://photos7.flickr.com/9386788_ab57fb3cc3_o.png" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-left: 20px;" style="border: 0px none;" /> </center> <ul><li>Change the options as shown.</li></ul><br />PS: Though there is an <a href="http://www.spuler.us/extensions/singlewindow.htm">extension</a> to do the same, I faced some problems with it when I tried last.<br /><br />PPS: From Tools->Options->Download option, disable Download Manager. <br /><center><img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/9388384_9a074df3cf_o.png" /></center>As even download manager confuses session saver. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
