<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/03/0515250&amp;from=rss">this story</a> at <a href="http://slashdot.org/">/.</a>:<br /><i></i><blockquote><i>"Probably due to the <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/19/2315200&amp;tid=123">Microsoft suit against Google</a> over human resources, some very heated exchanges have turned up in some court documents. Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer has apparently <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/microsoft-ceo-im-going-to-fing-kill-google/2005/09/03/1125302772214.html">vowed to kill Internet search leader Google</a>, according to documents filed in the increasingly bitter battle between the rivals."</i> From the article: <i>"At some point in the conversation, Mr. Ballmer said: 'Just tell me it's not Google,'' Lucovosky said in his statement. Lucovosky replied that he was joining Google. 'At that point, Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room hitting a table in his office,' Lucovosky recounted, adding that Ballmer then launched into a tirade about Google CEO Eric Schmidt. 'I'm going to f***ing bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. I'm going to f***ing kill Google.' Schmidt previously worked for Sun Microsystems and was the CEO of Novell."</i></blockquote></p><p>BTW check out <a href="http://www.ntk.net/ballmer/mirrors.html">Ballmer Videos</a> if you haven't already.
