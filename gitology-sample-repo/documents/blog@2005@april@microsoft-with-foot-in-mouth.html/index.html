<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>So I had to evaluate <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">IronPython</a> for its suitability to use from license point of view. There are 200 thousand gazillion open source projects on the internet, and I never had any problem figuring out their license, but this one is special, its by Microsoft. On the front page of IronPython they say:<br /><blockquote>  IronPython-0.6 is now available as Open Source Software under the  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html">Common Public License version 1.0</a>.   A single zip file containing both the source code and the binary executables can  be downloaded below. <ul> <li><a href="http://www.ironpython.com/IronPython-0.6.zip">  IronPython-0.6.zip</a> released on July 28, 2004</li> </ul></blockquote> <br />What is CPL? This place <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/faq.general.html">says</a>: <blockquote> Can closed source applications use UWIN?   <p> The CPL license does not require you to make your source code available in order to use CPL software. The GPL license requires you to make source code available for any binaries that use GPL code. As long as you do not use any GPL code, you can use UWIN without making your source code available. </p> </blockquote><br />Very well, so we think its the typical run of the mill BSD like license, suitable for my application. I got further confidence after reading <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonmatusow/archive/2005/04/05/IronPython_Q_and_A.aspx">this</a>:<br /><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> How can Microsoft refer to the IronPython license as &#226;BSD-like&#226; when there are some obvious differences between the two?<br /><strong>A:</strong> In an attempt to simplify the broad array of licenses available in the OSI-approved arena, there are permissive (BSD-like) licenses and reciprocal (GPL-like) licenses. It was under this premise that we referred to the IronPython license as BSD-like. You may want to check out my other <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/jasonmatusow/archive/2005/03/10/394009.aspx">blog entry </a>on this topic.</blockquote><br />So far so good. Out of curiosity I decided to check out the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/jasonmatusow/archive/2005/03/10/394009.aspx">blog entry</a> mention in last sentence there:<br /><blockquote>Reciprocal grants are generally based on the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">GPL </a>style of license. Microsoft has a colorful history with this license, but the fact remains that this is a pervasive form of licensing. If one is to deeply understand the nature of <st1:city st="on"><st1:place st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city>, one has to think through reciprocal licensing. In fact, we have three <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharedsource">Shared Source </a>projects (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix">WiX</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl">WTL</a>, and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexwiki">FlexWiki</a>) under a reciprocal license, the <a href="http://http//www.opensource.org/licenses/cpl1.0.php">Common Public License</a>.</blockquote><br />Now they say CPL is reciprocal license, similer to GPL! [Totally unacceptable for my application]. Do they even know the difference? The blog write seems not to [he starts with a para on the meaning of "open" picked from encarta!], but why is such a person be the spokseman of licensing issues then? Scoble any explainations? Do you intentionally want to fool people into thinking it is BSD like while it actually is <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/License.aspx?id=ad7acff7-ab1e-4bcb-99c0-57ac5a3a9742">GPL like</a>?<br /><blockquote>Clause 2: ... and if you distribute the Software solely in object form you only do so under a license that complies with this license.</blockquote><br />No, thankyou. I do not intend to make my application "open source" to adher to this license.<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
