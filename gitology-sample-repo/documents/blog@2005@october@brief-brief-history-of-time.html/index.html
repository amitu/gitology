So there must be some way we can tell how much entropy the black hole has.<br /><br />Bekenstein: *is a research student* *raises hand*<br /><br />Hawking: Question from the guy at the back in the Pantera hoodie? With the hot rock burns in it?<br /><br />Bekenstein: What about the area of the event horizon? You said earlier that it got bigger when stuff fell in it and that&#8230;<br /><br />Hawking: That would seem to fit the bill. Nice idea. But I don&#8217;t like it.<br /><br />Bekenstein: *cries*<br /><br />Hawking: You see, if that&#8217;s true, then it means that the black hole has to have a temperature. And if it has a temperature, it ought to be emitting stuff.<br /><br />The Universe: *is enjoying this immensely*<br /><br />Hawking: And like I said, BLACK HOLES DON&#8217;T EMIT SHIT! RIGHT, BITCH?<br /><br />Bekenstein: *weeps*<br /><br />Hawking: Black holes are notable entirely for their not emitting anything. If a black hole begins to emit, then it surely is an ex-black hole! It has ceased to be a black hole! It has had its black hole privileges revoked! It is no longer a member of the &#8220;Eating planets for brunch club&#8221;.
