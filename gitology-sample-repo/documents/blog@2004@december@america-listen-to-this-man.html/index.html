<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/opinion/05friedman.html">If President Bush is looking for a legacy, I have just the one for him - a national science project that would be our generation's moon shot: a  crash science initiative for alternative energy and conservation to make America energy-independent in 10 years. Imagine if every American kid, in every school, were galvanized around such a vision. Ah, you say, nice idea, Friedman, but what does it have to do with your subject - foreign policy?
<br /> <br />Everything! You give me an America that is energy-independent and I will give you sharply reduced oil revenues for the worst governments in the world. I will give you political reform from Moscow to Riyadh to Tehran. Yes, deprive these regimes of the huge oil windfalls on which they depend and you will force them to reform by having to tap their people instead of oil wells. These regimes won't change when we tell them they should. They will change only when they tell themselves they must.
<br /> <br />When did the Soviet Union collapse? When did reform take off in Iran? When did the Oslo peace process begin? When did economic reform become a hot topic in the Arab world? In the late 1980's and early 1990's. And what was also happening then? Oil prices were collapsing.
<br /> <br />In November 1985, oil was $30 a barrel, recalled the noted oil economist Philip Verleger. By July of 1986, oil had fallen to $10 a barrel, and it did not climb back to $20 until April 1989. "Everyone thinks Ronald Reagan brought down the Soviets," said Mr. Verleger. "That is wrong. It was the collapse of their oil rents." It's no accident that the 1990's was the decade of falling oil prices and falling walls.</blockquote></span> <br />I would highly recommend bookmarking NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html">Opinion</a> page, and watching Friedman's columns regularly. Another columnist, you will find there and like, is Paul Krugman.
