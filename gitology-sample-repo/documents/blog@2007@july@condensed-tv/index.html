CNN is reporting on a (relatively) new website called <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/ptech/07/03/la.minisodes.ap/index.html">the Minisode Network</a> that allows users to watch popular television shows that have been strategically condensed down to somewhere between four and six minutes.

<em>"Don't think of the Minisode Network as a brand-new Web site. Think of it as a long-overdue public service. That is, who among us hasn't felt the double-edged sword of our media age: So much video from TV, DVDs, the Internet and even cell phones ... but too little time to watch it all? The Minisode Network has a solution. Launched in June as a broadband channel on the MySpace site, it offers, for our streaming pleasure, episodes of vintage Sony Pictures Television series like 'Silver Spoons,' 'Starsky & Hutch,' 'Diff'rent Strokes' and even Ricki Lake's talk show."</em>
