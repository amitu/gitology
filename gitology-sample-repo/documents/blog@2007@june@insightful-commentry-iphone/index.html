Since <a href="http://www.amitu.com/blog/2004/november/russel-predicts-iphone.html">two years I have been waiting</a> for an iPhone. Despite that I did not really follow various iPhone news too much, partly because of my aversion to the fanboy/hateboy extreme of emotions that Apple product attracts. vim vs emacs, linux vs windows and django vs the rest of them are sufficient to keep my plate full :-). Anyways, <a href="http://roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q2.07/34C8BD5D-E210-4A62-BE6F-FD21E046A397.html">this article</a>, talks about a lot of subtle news and side stories I missed. Good read.
