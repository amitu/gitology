<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/20140.html">Here</a> is a writeup by <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/">Bram</a>, inventor of BitTorrent about MS Avalanche. This bit makes the <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2005/06/key-idea-behind-microsoft-avalanche.html">key idea</a> I talked about yesterday a total non starter:<blockquote>The really big unfixable problem with error correction is that peers can't verify data with a secure hash before they pass it on to other peers. As a result, it's quite straightforward for a malicious peer to poison an entire swarm just by uploading a little bit of data. The Avalanche paper conveniently doesn't mention that problem.</blockquote><br />And he adds: "<span style="font-style: italic;">I'd like to clarify that Avalanche is </span><b style="font-style: italic;">vaporware</b><span style="font-style: italic;">. It isn't a product which you can use or test with, it's a bunch of proposed algorithms.</span>" <br /><br />Via <a href="http://gigaom.com/">GigaOm</a>. <br /> <br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
