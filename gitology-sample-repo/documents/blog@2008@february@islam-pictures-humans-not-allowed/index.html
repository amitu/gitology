<p>There is a controversy in the air because of Wikipedia refusing to take down pictures of historical paintings, sensitive to Muslims. Which is understandable, given the ever so brittle muslim sensitivities, but I was quite surprised to read this on their <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/2/removal-of-the-pics-of-muhammad-from-wikipedia" target="_blank">online petitions</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In Islam picture of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and <strong>other Humans are not allowed</strong>. </p></blockquote><p>Emphasis mine.This is just too much, I guess Flickr should expect a fatwa anytime now for showing pictures of millions of humans. Initially I thought it was some kind of error, may be by capitalizing the Human, they mean some special humans especially revered by them, not just ordinary human beings, but then came across <a href="http://the-petition.blogspot.com/2008/02/muhammad-wikipedia-and-media.html" target="_blank">this post</a>  by the person behind the petition: </p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold">The first question is. Is pictures or  illustrations of humans are allowed in Islam? </span><br /><strong><em>And the answer is NOT</em></strong>. And this is exactly opposite to Paul M. Cobb. This Islamic Law is derived from Quran and authentic HADITH, and both Quran and Hadith belong from the life of Muhammad to its not a 20th century Law. I know before 20th century there was no Fatwa about this but there was a common understanding between Muslims on this issue. The art of pictures and illustration of Muhammad (PBUH) was only practiced in Iran or Shia Muslims. One thing is very important in this issue, not all Shia practice this. Even then painting of face was not allowed in Shia community. That is why you will find majority of illustrations with a white blank face or a face covered with Vail. But in 20th century some illustrations showing face were discovered and then Muslim scholars decided to put a Fatwa or Islamic Law in place to block this move. </p></blockquote><p>I wonder how is Internet legal in Muslim countries! Or even news papers. Or movies or arts. </p><p>I can understand the out cry against cartoons or other pictures intended as mocking or insulting Islam, but these are historical pictures done by Muslim artists under Muslim kings. </p><p>This significance of this episode in my opinion is this: a well meaning, educated and moderate Muslim will hate this, and will want the photos to be taken down, where as a well meaning, educated and moderate westerner will want the photos to stay. Unlike the cartoons, Wikipedia is not going to go away and fade into history. This could be the first time the veil of &quot;its only the extremists who hate each other&quot; will be lifted. </p><p>Only time will tell.&nbsp; </p><p>PS: <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=445648&amp;cid=22338160" target="_blank">On why the pictures should be removed</a>. </p>
