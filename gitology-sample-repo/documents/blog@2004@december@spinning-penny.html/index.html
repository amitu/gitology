<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Whenever you're called on to make up your mind,
<br />and you're hampered by not having any,
<br />the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find,
<br />is simply by spinning a penny.
<br /> <br />No - not so that chance shall decide the affair
<br />while you're passively standing there moping;
<br />but the moment the penny is up in the air,
<br />you suddenly know what you're Hoping.
