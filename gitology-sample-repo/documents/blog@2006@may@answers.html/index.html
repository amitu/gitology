<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>In short, there is this (bloody?) thing called democracy. 61% of Indian population is deciding to give themselves unfair advantage. The question in life never is what is wrong or right, the question is what do people think is wrong or right. 61% think the 27% have failed them and hate them from their bottom of their hearts. You have to gain their confidence before you can get them to listen to you. Think people. Think how they think.<br /><br />You can not reason someone out of from where they did not reason themselves in.<br /><br />(But) You can make people friends.<br /><br />Is India better off without reservations but people still hating us? Vengence may not be the best word, but it might not be the worst choice either to describe what is that we are dealing with here. I would any day let them "win" here and forget "history".<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
