<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.edge.org/questioncenter.html">World Question Center</a> is asking "What I believe and can't prove?" to some 120 well knows experts in their fields, <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html">answers</a> has some interesting ideas.
<br /> <br />What I believe and can not prove: Something close to "That we have infinite capacity to remember things" or "That we can handle infinite many pieces of information". This I use to arrive at another maxim which says we should never take decisions. When we are taking decisions, we are taking n bits of information and trying to arrive to one summary for that. When we decide something is good or bad, we take in lots of input(pros and cons to that decision, pros won), but after the decision is taken we have the tendency to discard the cons pieces of information. Why we do it is because we find ourselves incapable of handling these information, ofcourse sometimes we also take decisions to act on them, but the constraint that makes the decision mandatory is obviously an evil thing and measures should be taken to avoid them. Root of all evil in the world according to some Indian philosophies is to assume there is a good/bad right/wrong distinction, which is what we are doing all the time when we are making decisions, which we do because not many people believe in infinite memory/information capacity thing. This is the same heart vs mind argument we keep hearing about, how we should follow our heart and stuff, as soon as the reason for doing a thing becomes "because I like to" from "because it is right", the world becomes very nice place, tho ofcourse I can not prove it, which is okay given the topic of the blog I guess :P. There is a major difference between what Hinduism tells you and what other religions, we take "religion" as something that tells you what is "the right thing to do" (and many religions elaborate in great details about what will happen if you do or don't do them), but Veda's start with a declaration that you can not take books, sensory perception, rational deductions, memory etc as a source of reliable information. Veda's don't want you to make any decisions, unless you have found the truth, and a good check to see if so is the case is to try to fly through the buildings, if you can't you are not the one, and you haven't found the truth yet, so just drop your stupid assumption that you know anything enough to make any decision. BTW Gita goes in long details how to cope with this uncertainty, but in short I can say you try to find your type, what makes your most comfortable, and do it, don't try to do what other types do [bad thing they dwelled on the type concept too long and invented the caste system, anyways].
