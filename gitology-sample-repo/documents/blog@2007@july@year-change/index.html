I haven&#39;t felt so happy about the computer world since I was trying to get my commodore64 to flash the boarder colors as quickly as possible. We have Dell selling Linux, (and apparently it&#39;s selling well), we have Macintosh sales up 33% from the same quarter last year (and that&#39;s even WITH people waiting for Leopard to come out), and Vista adoption is slow. Suddenly it looks as though finally the innovation stranglehold that Microsoft has held over us for many years is coming to an end. I&#39;m not saying Microsoft will go away, but cross-platform compatibility will become the rule, not the exception. It will be easy to choose whichever platform you like, without worrying about not being able to run half your applications. Freedom will be a realistic choice.<br /> I suppose it was really inevitable in the long run, but I am happy to see the walls finally cracking.</div></blockquote> 		 	<p>Amen!  </p>
