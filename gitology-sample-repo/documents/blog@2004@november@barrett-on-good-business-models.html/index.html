<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>"The music industry absolutely stonewalled the distribution method associated with the Internet to the point that peer-to-peer sharing became so prevalent, that it didn't make much difference," Barrett said.
<br /> <br />"Five to eight years too late we are starting to see distribution models set up for distributing music over the Internet, where actually somebody gets paid for it," he said. "People are inherently honest and want to pay for goods and services and that would have happened if the music industry had adopted the technology and come up with commercial distribution models a lot earlier."
<br /> <br />The film industry faces a similar challenge as bandwidth increases enable downloading movies over the Internet. "It would be interesting to watch whether the movie industry will in fact rapidly and aggressively adopt a distribution model consistent with the new technology," he said. </blockquote></span> <br />So who is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,63263,00.html">wrong</a>?
