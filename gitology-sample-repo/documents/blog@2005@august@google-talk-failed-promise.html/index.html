<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across this very nice <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/nugget/97081.html">article</a> about <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>'s <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/about.html#open">broken promise</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">UPDATE</span>: <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2005-August/021792.html">There is news</a> that Google has updated their <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html#service_4">developer page</a>, and promise that server to server federation will be supported.<br /><br />There is also this interesting history of pre 1991 email that I din't know about:<br /><blockquote>There was a time when email was quite nearly as screwed up as instant messaging is today. When a person handed you a business card in 1991 the odds were pretty high that you'd have your choice from a legion of email addresses. There would be the ubiquitous CompuServe UID, a BIX id, maybe a GEnie address, FidoNet perhaps, Delphi, and Bob help you -- sometimes even a Prodigy account (the precursor to geocities if there ever was one).<br /><br />People ended up having to establish presence on each of these separate networks. All the systems had their own unique quirks and limitations and the situation was a total mess. Human handshaking became a negotiation nearly as complicated as the modem protocols that hardware used.<br /><br /><table border="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://colo.slacker.com/postpics/mailicon.jpg" style="border: 0px none ;" height="128" width="125" /></td> <td><i>"Yeah, so mainly I use GEnie"<br />"Erg, I'm not on GEnie any more.  I stick mostly to BiX"<br />"BiX?  Yuck.  Are you on CompuServe?"<br />"Are you nuts? I just got a 2400 baud modem. Have you seen what they charge an hour for prime time 2400 baud access? How about Fido?"<br />"Yeah I'm on 1:231/250."<br />"Cool"</i></td></tr></tbody> </table><br />...and so the dance went any time you needed to email a new person.<br /><br />Eventually the major service providers began establishing complicated gateways between the systems, but I'm not convinced that these hacks and <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/mail/inter-network-guide/">their ad hoc and confusing demands</a> represented an improvement. At best it worked but usually it just left you wondering if your mail really made it through. It was a solid win if your mail just made it to the right person on the same day and all in one piece.<br /><br />In a short amount of time, coincident with the sudden wave of TCP/IP adoption in consumer operating systems, the SMTP email protocol began to take hold as the most effective common ground. Each enclave network began to add SMTP gateways for linking to the rest of the world. In what seemed almost overnight at the time, suddenly everyone was talking SMTP natively, Just Like That. Everyone could email everyone else and life was good.</blockquote></p><p>Nice example of importance of open standards.</p><p>On a lesser serious note:</p><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upadhyay/38552966/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos25.flickr.com/38552966_5630a5973c_o.png" alt="google-talk-ads" style="border: 0px none ;" align="middle" height="483" width="350" /></a></center><p>Via <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-30.html#n63">Google Blogscoped</a>.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
