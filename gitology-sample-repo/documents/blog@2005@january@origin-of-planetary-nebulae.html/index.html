<br /></p><p></p> <blockquote> <p>A typical star weighing less than about twice the mass of the Sun spends most of its lifetime shining as a result of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" title="Nuclear fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reactions converting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> in its core. The energy released in the fusion reactions prevents the star from collapsing under its own gravity, and the star is stable.</p> <p>After several billion years, the star runs out of hydrogen, and there is no longer enough energy flowing out from the core to support the outer layers of the star. The core thus contracts and heats up. Currently the sun's core has a temperature of approximately 15 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a>, but when it runs out of hydrogen, the contraction of the core will cause the temperature to rise to about 100 million K.</p> <p>The outer layers of the star expand enormously because of the very high temperature of the core, and become much cooler. The star becomes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant" title="Red giant">red giant</a>. The core continues to contract and heat up, and when its temperature reaches 100 million K, helium nuclei begin to fuse into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>. The resumption of fusion reactions stops the core's contraction. Helium burning soon forms an inert core of carbon and oxygen, with a helium-burning shell surrounding it.</p> <p>Helium fusion reactions are extremely temperature sensitive, with reaction rates being proportional to T<sup>40</sup>. This means that just a 2% rise in temperature more than doubles the reaction rate. This makes the star very unstable - a small rise in temperature leads to a rapid rise in reaction rates, which releases a lot of energy, increasing the temperature further. The helium-burning layer rapidly expands and therefore cools, which reduces the reaction rate again. Huge pulsations build up, which eventually become large enough to throw off the whole stellar atmosphere into space<sup>[3]</sup>.</p> <p>The ejected gases form a cloud of material around the now-exposed core of the star. As more and more of the atmosphere moves away from the star, deeper and deeper layers at higher and higher temperatures are exposed. When the exposed surface reaches a temperature of about 30,000K, there are enough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a> being emitted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionisation" title="Ionisation">ionise</a> the ejected atmosphere, making it glow. The cloud has then become a planetary nebula.
<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>Quite fascinating, answers my age old curiosity on how can a dying star shoot material out of it. Shit I am missing all those episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation">Startrek TNG</a> so much.
