<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Apparently someone has taken a clue from Apple's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dmg">dmg</a>-s and created klik for KDE. Some details are available in the <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1126867980/">announcement</a>, while the rest in the <a href="http://klik.atekon.de/docs/">documentation</a>. klik makes it possible to install and run an application from a website just by a single click, and have already a really large number of applications are <a href="http://klik.atekon.de/">available</a>. Installing or removing an application is as simple as copying and deleting a file. Yes they include a lot of dependecies, and yes its not the most optimal utilization of libraries, but the convenience it offers is well worth it. The fact that the builders can decide what should be distributed and which libraries are to be assumed to be available on the base system, its not that inefficient either. Another good thing about it is its distribution neutral, so it works well with Debian as well as for SUSE or Linspire. And its not KDE specific either, though priliminary implementation is written for KDE.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
