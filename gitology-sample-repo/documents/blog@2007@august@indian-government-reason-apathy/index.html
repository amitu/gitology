<p>Came across this insightful <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/foreign/peterfoster/august2007/indiangovernment.htm" target="_blank">comment</a>  on Peter Foster&#39;s blog:<br /> </p><blockquote><p>In India, development is INSPITE of the government while in China, development is DUE to the government.<br /><br />Of course, a large part of India has been very unfortunate in having despotic, cruel, oppressive regimes (&#39;governments&#39;) for the last 700+ years or so. Indians thus have become used to the fact that they should not depend on the government and that they have to do most of it themselves, including building private roads (the rich) where necessary, arranging potable water supply (the private tankers) etc.</p></blockquote><p>So true! We never had a phase of well meaning kings or rulers in our history.&nbsp; </p>
