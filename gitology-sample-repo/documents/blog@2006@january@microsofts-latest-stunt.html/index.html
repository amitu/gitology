Before they fool themselves with the latest MS stunt, I hope they read <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/countering_trus.html">Countering "Trusting Trust"</a> to get a hint of what issues are faced when we are dealing with trust.</p> <p>I mean seriously, Microsoft wants people to <span style="font-style:italic;">trust them</span> that the source they are offering is the one that is used for actual build, in an <span style="font-style:italic;">antitrust</span> case! Either give complete source code, not a single line missing of the operating system, all driver, every peice of compiler toolchain, and any other peice of code that might be involved in from the source to the binary that is written on cd, along with complete source code of the burning software of course, and complete documentation of how to build them, and then <span style="font-style:italic;">maybe</span> showing source code may have any sense.</p> <p>And BTW if you notice very carefully, I am not the one who asked them to open their source, I am not saying they should, all I am saying is if there is <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> use of opening source code, it can happen only if whats mentioned above happens.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
