This site focuses on India specific topics. Anyone can submit a story for discussion, and our editors will edit it and publish it on the site. Anyone subscribed to http://somepickle.in <a href="http://somepickle.in/somepickle.rss" target="_blank">rss feed</a> will get latest stories, and they can read the views of other people about it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rediff has comments, so does blogs, there are forums, so why this?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The key point is moderation and reputation. So many comments you find on many news sites/blogs are just &quot;me too&quot; or &quot;they suck&quot; or something trivial like that. This does not encourage participation as finding signal to noise ratio is quite high in those systems. Somepickle.in is powered by <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/" target="_blank">slashcode</a>  that powers slashdot, and distinction of <a href="http://slashdot.org/" target="_blank">slashdot</a>  from <a href="http://digg.com" target="_blank">digg</a>  for example is, the value you get from the quality comment you read in the slashdot stories.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How is quality of comments/discussion achieved?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Slashcode has a comment moderation and meta moderation system. Every user who signs up on our system is given some kerma, default is 5 for example. The kerma of a user increases when the comment by the user gets moderated +1 or -1. A comment has a kerma rating too, the kerma can go from -1 to +5. If the kerma of the user posting the comment is high, beyond a certain threshold,&nbsp; the default kerma of a newly posted comment would be +2, otherwise if the comment is from a registered user, the initial kerma would be +1. Anonymous users can post a reply too, or a user can post a comment anonymously, in which case the initial kerma of the comment would be +0.<br /><br />Then comes moderation. Randomly, users are picked and are given moderation points. How many moderation point given and how often a user is picked, depends on the users kerma, the higher it is, the more the user can moderate. When user is eligible for moderation, as decided by the system based on the said rules, user will see moderation options along with each comment they come across. A moderator has many options moderate a comment, for example user may consider it: <br /><br />Normal: Gives 0 kerma to a comment and the poster, this is the default state of a new comment. This can be given if the moderator wants to undo moderations for a comment, lets say if the moderator sees a comment &quot;+5 Insightful&quot; and thinks the comment is deserving, but its not perticularly insightful, its just a normal good quality comment. <br /><br />Offtopic: This is a negative moderation, the poster and the comment will get 1 points deducted from their respective kermas. This is given when commenter posts something totally unrelated to the discussion going on. <br /><br />Flamebait: This is another negative moderation, 1 point will be deducted. This is used when it appears to the moderator that the intent was provoking an angry reply. For example there might be a contentious issue that has been resolved, but the commenter has knowingly ignored the resolution and alleged something completely contrary to resolution. &nbsp;<br /><br />Troll: This is also a negative moderation, 1 point deducted. This is quite similar to flamebait, but in this case the intent of the commenter is not to provoke an angry reply and get hasty response, but to pretend to be serious about the topic, but is intentionally being ignorant and saying wrong thing. <br /><br />Redundant: Negative, -1. This is a me too type comment, someone repeating something that has already been said or discussed, and has no meaningful value. <br /><br />Insightul: This gives +1 to the comment and the poster, and is used when some new insight has been shed by the comment. Something I did not initially seem connected are actually connected, it will be insightful for example. It usually comes from indepth/accidental knowledge/research. <br /><br />Interesting: Postive, +1, this is used when something interesting is being said, for some general agreeable meaning of &quot;interesting&quot;.<br /><br />Informative: Postive +1. This is when someone posts a link or write something that shed more information about what is being discussed. <br /><br />Funny: Positive +1, doesn&#39;t really require an explaination. <br /><br />Overrated: Negative -1 moderation, this is when the moderator feels the comment has got more moderation than it deserves. <br /><br />Underrater: Positive +1, this is opposite of Overrated. <br /><br /><a href="http://somepickle.in/moderation.shtml" target="_blank">Moderation guide</a>  contains more detailed information about the moderation system. </p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>With such extensive rules it is hoped that most of comments you come across would be of worth your time, and will thus encourage users to participate, and hopefully contribute towards everybody&#39;s understanding about things that are happening around us. We need users, so please let others know about it. Happy Independence Day everybody!<br /> </p><p>PS: Thanks goes to <a href="http://www.hurrhurr.com/fn/" target="_blank">Thakkar</a>  and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gera/292122254/" target="_blank">Amol</a>  for site and logo design respectively, mind you, they are not done yet, and any screwups you notice is our faults. &nbsp; </p>
