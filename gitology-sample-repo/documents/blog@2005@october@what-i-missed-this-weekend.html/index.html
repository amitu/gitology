<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Was planning to go to Humpi, <a href="http://chaturvedi.blogspot.com/2005/10/dragonflies-are-kamikaze.html">here</a> is what I would have seen had I managed:<br /><blockquote>When riding at 90kmph on NH4, please wear a full face helmet. If I could record the taps on my helmet, I could surely use those for percussion in any kind of classical or rock number. I&#226;ll never know how many dragonflies reached the other side after hitting us. After 9 hrs of drive, interrupted by tea and snack breaks, we reached <a href="http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/india/karnataka/hampi">Hampi</a> market. It was 3 in a pleasant afternoon. Hampi is a small laidback place, a bit crowded at this time of the year owing to Dussera festivities.<br /><br />The past is so pronounced that only a dork will be unable to imagine how the city must&#226;ve been 800 years ago. Temples, as always, are history etched in stone. They paint a comprehensive picture of contemporary art, science, commerce, society, and everything under the medieval sun.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1933/592/1600/IMG_2812.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1933/592/320/IMG_2812.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> So what does this pillar, with a statue of a man playing the <span style="font-style: italic;">damroo</span> in front and thin columns on its sides, tell us? Not just about the musical inclination of the people. It so happens that striking those columns with knuckles (or wooden sticks) produces the sound of <span style="font-style: italic;">damroo</span>. Other pillars have statues of artists with <span style="font-style: italic;">mridanga</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">dhol</span>, and other classical musical instruments and striking the columns produces the sounds of corresponding instruments. Look at the column at the right side of this statue, and one in the background. The former is octagonal, the latter is fluted. Each has a distinct diameter, a unique shape, and a different tension owing to the weight of the stone structure placed at the top; and probably other features that help producing different sounds. All of these columns are made of solid stone though. There were also columns that were as sonorous as the brass bells used in Hindu temples. And then there is a pillar with eight columns, each of which produces a note in the octave. Inscriptions have it that there were about 56 such pillars. When played, the sound of music travelled as far as a kilometer.</blockquote></p><p>I envy you Namit :-)</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
