As so often with k5 or /., comments were more interesting than the original story, here are a few:<br /><span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;"> <b></b></span><blockquote><span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;"><b>You missing the point entirely</b> (<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2005/3/3/153759/8577/76?mode=alone;showrate=1#76">2.00 / 5</a>) (<a class="light" href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2005/3/3/153759/8577/76#76">#76</a>)  </span><br /> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">by <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/uid:17898">greggman</a> on Fri Mar 4th, 2005 at 02:45:39 PM EST<br />(<a class="light" href="mailto:http://greggman.com/pages/email.htm">http://greggman.com/pages/email.htm</a>) <a class="light" href="http://greggman.com/">http://greggman.com</a></span> <br /> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">It's not about users editing the content.  It's not about business models.  It's not about sacred content.  It's about one company (one person) having a chance to edit every webpage for millions of people.</span> <p> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">Right now if you search for Bush you'll get lots of sites pro and con.  Pro sites will have pro links, con sites will have con links.  When version 1.1 of Autolinks appears that does more than the 4 types of data it does now then google will now have a chance to make all those links point one way or the other, pro or con.  That power will be concentrated in one company.  That is the scary part.  You think it's scary that people get most of their news from 4-5 TV news sources?  Just wait till the day when all online news sources pass through the editing hand of google and google alone.</span></p> <p> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">it's gets worse.  Assume google doesn't actually directly control the content but uses pagerank to decide where links to a certain topic go.  Then, who ever figures out how to hack pagerank (which many people have already done) will have a HUGE influence in shaping public opinion.</span></p> <p> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">Face it, techinically it's great idea.  Instead of manually searching for stuff with my personal phrase of preference (bush president, bush oil, bush iraq) each person deciding for themselves how to search, the convienence of Autolink 1.1 will be "just click that button and I'll get links selected by google as the best links for more info" and everyone else will get the exact same links.</span></p> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">That's NOT good if you want diverse opinions.<br /> </span></blockquote><br />And:<br /><span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;"> <b></b></span><blockquote><span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;"><b>Opt-In for Content Providers?

But content producters <b>DO NOT</b> get to control how I view their content. This has been the way the web has worked since it began. The CLIENT is responsible for the presentation of the content. If I want to reformat it, add to it, do anything I want to it, I can do that. The thing is, <b>you can not stop this!</b> The server has no way of knowing what the client has done to the content after it has been sent.<br /><br />There are already DOZENS of browser plug-ins and tools that alter or enhance web-page content in some form or fashion. If you suggest that content providers have some say in whether or not this happens, all of a sudden all of those devices have to support "opt-in" too.<br /><br />Don't like those pop-up ads? Too fucking bad, we haven't "opted in" to allow you to block them.<br /><br />If you try to make some stupid law and/or standard that supports opt-in for content producers, that just means there will be "underground" browsers that do not support this feature. In other words, no one will be using Internet Explorer anymore, they'll be using 1nt3rn37 Xpl0r3r, because it has all the features of IE, without the limitation of forcing me to be at the mercy of the content provider. There is <b>no way</b> to avoid this! The server has SENT the data, it is now COMPLETELY in the hands of the client, and there is no way for the server to prevent the client from altering its presentation.<br /><br />You want to talk about slippery slope. The slippery slope is there, but it's going the opposite way you think it is. You start suggesting that content-providers actually have some say in what is being displayed on the client end, and all of a sudden you've made just about every internet tool currently in existence illegal.<br /><br />Now back to the main thrust -- <b>autolinking</b>:<br /><br />I think it's a great tool if used responsibly. As long as the user of the software is <b>PERFECTLY AWARE</b> of where that link is being generated, and not able to confuse a link generated by the content provider and by the tool that is doing autolinking, I don't have a problem with it. As <a href="http://www.craphound.com/bio.html">Cory Doctorow</a> wrote on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/26/why_you_should_love_.html">BoingBoing</a>, the problem ONLY occurs if there is some deception involved, and that's a problem with whoever wrote the tool doing the decieving, not the actual technology of autolinking in and of itself.<br /><br />As a user I would only be interested in this product, however, if it: <br /><br />1. let me customize where the autolinks go to, for example, if it's autolinking a book, I want the option to have it search Barnes & Noble or Amazon.com as I see fit, not be forced into a choice by the maker of the tool just because they get "kick-backs".<br />2. no one gets a kick-back unless the author of the web page that I was reading gets one.<br />3. no one gets a kick-back if I don't want them to get a kick-back. It's my money, I get to decide who gets it.<br />4. I am always fully aware of where the link is being generated.<br />5. It's completely optional and "turn-on per use" type thing, it isn't something enabled all the time while browsing.<br /><br />Those are my conditions before *I* would use it, YMMV. BTW, I am using Firefox so I can't use the Google thning even if it does work the way I want it to. I would be very interested in a FireFox plug-in that did something similar though.<br /><br /><br />--Knight37</span><span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;"><br /> <br />Once a Gamer, always a <a href="http://knightgames.blogspot.com/">Gamer</a> </span><br /></blockquote><br />In general the modification is a Good Idea. Ctrl-+/Ctrl-- to increase/decrease font sizes, user defined stylesheet, esp in Opera to convert all the pale white on black fancy coloring on some site to sane black on white. Then you can think of a plugin to put a tooltip on all the non common words with their meaning when you are visiting a site in a languge you are learning, or another plugin that shows a page in a paragraph by paragraph manner, show one para with head aligned with the top, press Space and next para [or the part of para not visible on the screen] takes that place, and I am sure numerous other innovations are possible. Therefore arguments in the line of modification of content is a voilation of copyright are bad. The reason I could be against it is in the lines of:<br /><span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;"> <b></b></span><blockquote><span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;"><b>If you love the Internet, you better be worried.</b> (<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2005/3/3/153759/8577/96?mode=alone;showrate=1#96">1.33 / 3</a>) (<a class="light" href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2005/3/3/153759/8577/96#96">#96</a>)  </span><br /> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">by <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/uid:59979">Marknot</a> on Fri Mar 4th, 2005 at 09:27:46 PM EST<br /></span> <br /> <span style="font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;">It isn't what the toolbar does to the webpage, it is what it does to the web.

Microsoft, real evil thing: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/02/15/373104.aspx">IE7 is in the line</a>, and they will/might put forced [which means active by default, and a hidden entry on msdn site to disable it] autolinking, make IE7 mandatory to get security updates, force people to use security updates by floating a lethal virus/worm and suing some Russian about it, and zap instantly all pages on the internet show ads/content by Microsoft, and we all know where they would point to on all pages showing information about using linux or Mac over Microsoft for example. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
