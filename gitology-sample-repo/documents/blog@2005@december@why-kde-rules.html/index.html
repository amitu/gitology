<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Just submitted a story on <a href="http://slashdot.org">/.</a>, don't know if it would be accepted or not, so here is the text for the privileged you:</p><blockquote>As a fan of KDE I have been disappointed to see KDE mocked and not appreciated on slahsdot in general, their obsession with K, not having non GPL/LGPL libraries to develop on it, similarities with Microsoft Windows in default theme and settings, and allaged lack of "usability" combined eclipse the technology that is KDE. Diego Calleja describes <a href="http://www.terra.es/personal/diegocg/kde/index2.html">Why KDE Rules</a> to "..tell everybody why KDE is great, why it's worth using (great functionality), supporting (great development platform) and hacking (great design) and why you can expect many other awesome features from KDE 4." </blockquote><p>Enjoy!</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
