<p>Was reading a <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/bstephens/?id=110010529" target="_blank">rebuffal of global warning</a>  on by this fellow, here is something I found really interesting: </p><blockquote><p>I confess: I understand that global warming may have negative consequences. Heat waves, droughts and coastal flooding may become more intense. Temperature-sensitive viruses such as malaria could become more widespread. Lakes may be depleted by evaporation. Animal life will suffer.<br /><br />But as Bjorn Lomborg points out in his sharp, persuasive and aptly titled book &quot;Cool It,&quot; a warming climate has advantages, too, and not just trivial ones. Though global warming will cause more heat deaths, it will also mean many fewer cold deaths. Drought may increase in some areas, but warming also means both more rain and longer growing seasons. Temperature changes will harm some wildlife in some places. But many species will benefit from a bit more warmth. Does anyone know for certain that the net human and environmental losses from global warming will exceed overall gains?&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>This is the crux of matter, isn&#39;t it. Global warning is bad is a naive statement. Global warming is bad for warmer(=under developed) countries, and is <strong>good</strong> for colder(=developed) countries. Nobody mentions this fact in global warming debates, as if assuming Bush and party are equally concerned of death of Americans and death of Middle Easterns. The whole global warming debates makes so much sense now.&nbsp;  </p>
