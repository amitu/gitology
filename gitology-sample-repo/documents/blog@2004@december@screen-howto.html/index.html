All screen commands start with <strong>Ctrl-a</strong>. </p> <p> To Open a new screen within the screen session: </p> <p> <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-c</strong>. </p> <p> To switch: </p> <p> <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-a</strong> to last accessed screen. <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-n</strong> to next, <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-p</strong> to previous screens. </p> <p> To disconnect, leaving the session running in background: <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-d</strong>.</p> <span class="fullpost"> </span><p> Full list of available command can be obtained by doing <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-?</strong> </p> <p> To connect to an already open session running in background, use "screen" with following options:
<br /></p> <ul> <li>-d -r   Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.</li> <li> -d -R   Reattach a session and if necessary detach or  even  create  it              first.</li> <li> -d -RR Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first session if more than one session is available.</li> <li> -D -r   Reattach a session. If necessary  detach  and  logout  remotely              first.</li> <li> -D -R Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely first. If it was not running create it and notify the user. This is the author's favorite.</li> <li> -D -RR  Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.<span style="font-family:monospace;"></span></li> </ul> [[Note: It is always a good idea to check the status  of  your  sessions by means of "screen -list".]]
<br /><p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> My preferred option is screen -d -RR [put an alias for that in your .bashrc maybe]. If more than one person is using the same login on some machine and both are using screen, it may be advisable to use caution when doing this. </p> <p> Other cool thing to play with is: <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-S</strong> [capital S] to split the screen vertically in half, <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-Q</strong> to unsplit and <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-Tab</strong> to move focus to other side of split. </p> <p> Also to list the currently open screens in a screen sessions, <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-"</strong>, and to rename the current screen to a more meaningful name do a <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-A</strong> </p> <p> With all this <strong>Ctrl-a</strong> business if you miss sending Ctrl-a to the running program(for example to jump to the beginning of the readline buffer used to edit the commands we are passing to bash), do a <strong>Ctrl-a a</strong>. </p> <p> You can also instruct screen to monitor a screen for silence by <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-_</strong> [underscore], good to know when a program has stopped running in one of the hidden windows. </p> <p> Now I am sure it would be hard for you to live without screen. :-) </p> <p> One minor drawback: screen retains the DISPLAY setting of the terminal where it was first created, so if I want to quickly launch emacs etc, I detach, run the program and reattach again.
