<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> is giving some college <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html">advice</a>. The thing I like about his article's the most is the links to other ones, and they are almost always very interesting and insightful, and then they have links too. And did anyone say I am not in college anymore?, well, to the self trained, the world is a college :P
<br /> <br />PS: Have a great year!
