Take the <code>p</code> element, which is used to denote paragraphs, and the <code>br</code> element, used to force a line break. Anyone ever commit this markup crime?</p> <p><code></code></p><p>If you place the line above in a document between some text sections, youll get some white space, but the markup has absolutely no meaning. A paragraph tag should be used to denote a paragraph, period. A line break should be used to force a break in a line, not to gain white space.</p> <p> I should be taken to markup prison and/or fined for having done this for years! Fortunately, Ive got CSS by my side now, and can get back to cleaner living.</p> </blockquote><br />Question like should we put the quote in &lt;blockquote&gt; tag or &lt;i&gt; is dealing with <a href="http://brainstormsandraves.com/articles/semantics/structure/">semantics</a>. This person <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/02/27/the-meaning-of-semantics/#comment-8060">tries to justify</a> why choosing the one that is semantically correct is better thing to do.<br /><br />Consider Google's latest toolbar's <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html">AutoLink</a> as an example, it parses the current page you are viewing and converts data in it like ISBN number of books, to Amazon page listing for that book; and address information to a GoogleMap page that shows direction from your current location to the given address. Imagine a tool that looks at the page you are viewing, finds &lt;blockquote&gt;, does a google search on it and finds the original site, and creates small button near the quoted text, clicking on which will show the original text with the quoted text highlighted. Or a tool that finds the abbreviations and shows a tooltip containing the full form for it when you hover the mouse over it. All this services would be useful innovations, but creating them would become extremely difficult if people do not put the abbreviations in &lt;abbr&gt; and for say we will just put them in &lt;b&gt; do it consistently for our sites and our visitors will know it, and not put addresses in &lt;address&gt; and say we just show them in deep red font, or put all the &lt;blockquote&gt; material in &lt;i&gt;s. If everyone is creating standards, there is no standards at all.<br /><br />After ignorance,  the most important reason people ignore semantics is the fact that it used to be difficult to achieve the desired look at times without breaking semantics, but with CSS we have complete control, take a look at <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/">this</a> for example, that that reason no longer is valid. So  therefore respect semantics, not doing so may be hindering innovation. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
