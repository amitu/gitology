We've found that Google Suggest not only makes it easier to type in your favorite searches (let's face it -- we're all a little lazy), but also gives you a playground to explore what others are searching about, and learn about things you haven't dreamt of. Go ahead, <a href="http://labs.google.com/suggest">give it a spin</a>.</blockquote> <br />Other than the fact that its quite innovative and blazingly fast, (from the same <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/12/ive-got-suggestion.html">announcement</a>) one may notice: <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">What's really amazed me about this project is how   <span style="font-weight: bold;">in a matter of months, working on my own, I was able to go from a lunch table conversation to launching a new service</span>.</blockquote> <br />What I am trying to emphasise here is not that he is too cool or Google totally allows/encourages such stuff(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316743003/103-8293167-6207035?v=glance">skunk work</a>) and thus is really great company, both are true nevertheless, rather the fact that it was so <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=132312&amp;cid=11053245">easy</a>. Infact this is not even new, there is an open source implementation (<a href="http://blog4.bitflux.ch/wiki/LiveSearch">LiveSearch</a>) since atleast July this year (<a href="http://www.creatimation.net/journal/live-request">demo</a>). The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">basic technology</a> behind them is DHTML and WebServices and numerous books are available on both topics on any bookstore since years, and yet these are somehow "<span style="font-style: italic;">cutting edge</span>".  <a href="http://gmail.google.com/gmail">GMail</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> extensively uses them, and are the coolest services in their respective field, yet ironically so many technology companies shy away from technology.
