<p>I usually do not believe in isms like liberalism or socialism or capitalism; or rather I should say I go by &quot;makes-sense-ism&quot;. <br /><br />Since after talking about suicide in my <a href="http://www.amitu.com/blog/2007/december/comments-free-be-foolish/" target="_blank">blog post the other day</a>, I have come to change my opinion a little bit. The liberal stand on suicide seems to be &quot;its my body, and I should be free to do anything with it, including ending it, as long as its not affecting others&quot; or in other words &quot;right to live implicitly means right to not live, like right to speech implies right to stay silent&quot;. <br /><br />Lets see what makes-sense-ism say about this issue. First of all, its not suicide whose legality we are really talking about, its attempted suicide, so the liberal argument is kind of null and void. If someone is dead, it really doesn&#39;t matter if he committed a crime or not. Well not really, in old England for example, one used to lose his/her nobility if they committed suicide. Similarly they would not get normal funeral, the family may not get insurance benefits or other benefits from governments [though that would be punishing the wrong person]. But so is not the case in India, and few other countries countries with suicide laws, and suicide effectively can be considered beyond legal consequences. <br /><br />Now lets consider &quot;(failed) attempt to commit suicide&quot;, liberals and conservatives differ here. Liberals seems to imply that since nobody but the person who tried to commit suicide,&nbsp; is getting hurt in the process, it should really not be a crime. Right to live argument can not be really invoked here, but victimless crime can be, sort of. Conservatives, where as, seems to imply that its societies roll to protect every life, even from the person themselves, and thus society should do everything in their capacity to deter them from hurting themselves. <br /><br />Liberals are wrong. This is not a victimless crime. State resources are precious, emergency medical treatment, police investigation, that can be better utilized for someone really needy(who did not bring this to themselves) and there is kins&#39; emotional distress, and possibly financial too. This line of reasoning takes us close to conservative point of view, strong penalty seems to be warranted to deter people from committing suicide (and failing). Following this reasoning a lot of countries adopted suicide laws with penalties for attempted suicide. <br /><br />But conservatives are wrong too (but not for obvious reasons) (and a most of the countries did retract this law). The first argument that comes in mind after reading the above is: deterrence does not really work in this case, as you can not deter someone by scaring them about failure of what they are doing, as they are not aiming for failure anyways. You can not scare someone about going to some room, when they are not planning to go to that room in first place. Deterrence argument should be out of window. But not really, someone might say, this still is better than nothing, they will keep this in the back of their mind, and they would still consider the chance of failure and its consequences, and will be deterred a little bit. <br /><br />How do we resolve this? Or is it the valid conclusion? In the spirit of &quot;strong opinions, weakly held&quot;, my current opinion on this seems to be something like this: what really matters is if we consider the problem as a black box, without caring about what is right and wrong, and should be-s and should not not be-s, and focus on just rational conclusions and numbers to guide us. Let see what numbers would be affected, and which way we should try to move them. Sounds cold, but here is how the numbers play: since state has to provide medical treatment and police investigation anyways, penalty or no penalty is not making any difference in the amount of money spent by state. In fact jail costs, and so does judicial proceedings leading to it, so making it a crime is bad from economy point of view. <br /><br />The other number, which is probably a little more significant is number of lives lost/gained. If 500 people are dying today per unit time, and a new bill is passed, and the ultimate consequence of it is 600 people dying per unit time, everything else remaining equal, the law is bad, and if only 400 dies, then its good, this much we can say without knowing what the law states. So how will number of deaths be effected by this law? Think from the point of view of the person who just tried to kill themselves but failed. They probably cut themselves, and after hours they realize they are not going to die, and its just too painful, or may be they popped some pills and all they got is nausea and uncontrolled vomiting. Lets consider the failed attempts where the victim/culprit is suffering and need help, and they are faced with the question of calling it quits (may be just for now) and requesting help. [I am claiming that in the other case; wherein either the person is not suffering from any pain, or is still determined to die and is not planning to quit despite the pain or they have passed out or in so much pain to not be able to think; the number of deaths will depend on factors other than this law, and thus can be ignored from this discussion]. Now the suffering fellow is thinking, if suicide is a crime, and if he calls medical attention, he/she will be reported and charged, and jailed ultimately, and this will just add up to the misery that forced them to commit suicide in the first place. I guess the essence of my argument is: this law will not deter them from trying to commit suicide, this will deter them from calling for help when they fail. They will try all possible avenues, self treatment, reaching out to friends who may not be qualified enough, or contacting &quot;legally liberal with a fee&quot; doctors, and calling regular emergency numbers would really be the last resort that the victim/culprit would be mulling over. If nothing else this will waste precious amount of time (they would be sitting thinking/hoping/telling themselves that if they just waited a little more, the pain will go down, or may be they will pass out) that might end up being too costly given the emergency nature of the situation. If there was no fear of prosecution, the victim/culprit would just call for help as soon as they realize its even a little bit more painful than they expected. <br /><br />Recapping, suicide attempt laws increase the cost to state (judicial and correction facilities), and increase the number of deaths (due to improper or delayed medical attention), without reaping any benefits, and therefore does not make sense (to me at least, if you differ, speak up!), and therefore should be abolished from India, one of the few countries that still has such laws. </p><p>PS: What about planning to commit suicide, should it be legal? To me this is too much of a thought crime situation,&nbsp; where would one draw the line, when someone gets a gun? or when they confess to a friend that they are having such feelings? Shrink is what they need, not courts.&nbsp; </p>
