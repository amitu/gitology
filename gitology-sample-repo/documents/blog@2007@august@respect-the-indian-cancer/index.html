<p> India culturally places too much emphasis on respect. An article on rediff has this to <a href="http://in.rediff.com/money/2006/may/24anidut.htm" target="_blank">say</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p> We grow up in a society where we learn to respect and listen to adults, in many cases even if they are wrong. We address our neighbours by calling them uncle or aunts from early childhood. </p> <p> When we move into business, we tend to show a lot of respect and value to the folks who are higher up in the organisation or higher up in society. So, when they endorse something, it really means a lot to us. </p> <p> In our story, Ravi was trying to convince Bob with a status based persuasion approach. Bob on the other hand was constantly asking if these ministers, senior officials were engaged in similar real estate deals. Bob was trying to understand if Ravi was providing these names as credible references who &#39;has been there, done that&#39; with Ravi. The fact that these guys did not participate in a deal like this but were willing to vow for success criterion regarding this effort did not go well with Bob. </p> <p> Again, if you are negotiating with an American who is not prone to Indian ways, it may be better to provide credible reference that may not be big names rather than using big names to receive status based concession. </p> </blockquote> <p> Seeing things in this regard, respect seems to brew an authoritarian mind set, it places too much importance of status and individualism suffers. Respects eats up credibility.  </p> <p> <a target="_blank">Peter Foster</a>, found this emphasis on respect <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/foreign/peterfoster/august2007/india-culture.htm" target="_blank">refreshing</a> for a westerner. Our parents like it too.  </p> <p> If we respect people because we are supposed to respect them, and not because of what they have done, it leads to us turning a blind eye towards evaluating people, evaluating what they have done. Shashi&#39;s blog post on <a href="http://bechalis.blogspot.com/2007/08/pride-and-respect.html" target="_blank">pride and respect</a> also emphasises similar points: </p> <blockquote> <p> In my opinion, this - not taking pride in your work - is only one side of the coin. The other missing side of the argument is lack of respect for work. We don&#39;t believe in dignity of work - any work, however important or trivial it is!  &quot;You are an air hostess with SpiceJet or Air Deccan? You need to get out of the rat hole and join Kingfisher or Jet&quot; is our attitude. People think, as they are charged exorbitantly at five-star hotels, it is their birthright to curse every single thing and all the staff. We show respect (or pretend to) only to the people in the socio-economic strata higher than us. (And then we cry foul when we are at the receiving end of it and confirming that we are hypocrites.) </p> </blockquote> <p> We are culturally trained not to respect people&#39;s work and their actions, as it will invariably lead to situation where we are supposed to disrespect someone based on what they have done, but have to respect them because what they are. You will be blamed for not respecting someone higher up to you, you will be punished by that somebody and by others as being someone who does not respect people, and criticizes people. Respect based on status is a comfortable system for those in power, they do not want to be criticized, not be held accountable to their actions. We play it safe by just ignoring actions and focusing on the status. Teacher =&gt; respect, Elder=&gt; respect, Boss =&gt; respect, and we come to expect the same respect from others. If we do not respect people&#39;s work and actions, what we are left with is a <a href="http://www.livemint.com/2007/08/13000558/Mantra-for-a-60-year-old.html" target="_blank">very mediocre country</a>.  </p> <p> Indians are not good in taking or handing out criticism. The culture of respect says even answering back to someone is disrespectful. Looking into eyes is disrespectful. The system is so smooth with rules of respect driving every aspect of interpersonal interaction, that the moment someone tells you something against you, it becomes very personal. It no longer about the act that someone criticized and it becomes about you getting criticized. How dare he? is the first thought, and probably the only thought, not the credibility of the accusation. </p> <p> We always shout that politicians are only promising us stuff and not doing them, well this is what we get for being a respectful country. Status Based Respect == Lack of Respect for Action == Cancer of our country.  </p>
