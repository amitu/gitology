<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Yesterday morning some massive <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4126971.stm#text">devastation</a> took place. <a href="http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/mld/ledgerenquirer/news/nation/10503891.htm">Here</a> are some interesting details about its origin:
<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;"> <p>For decades, scientists say, tiny islands off the west coast of Sumatra have been sinking - an ominous sign that strain was building toward Sunday's great earthquake, which set off tidal waves that killed thousands of people.</p> <p>Researchers don't yet know exactly what happened. But if previous giant quakes in the region are any guide, the one Sunday would have suddenly pushed up the ocean bottom by a yard or two, raising a bulge of water on the surface that rippled out in all directions.</p> <p>The resulting waves, or tsunamis, would have been only a foot or so tall as they raced across the ocean at 500 to 600 mph.</p> <p>But when they hit shallower water near shore, they piled up into walls of water up to 30 feet high, depending on the shape of the coastline and the contours of the ocean bottom.</p> <p>The tsunamis might look like angry waves or rapidly rising tides. As the first one receded, exposing the ocean bottom, people would have been tempted to go gather up any fish left behind, only to be trapped by a second wave as powerful as the first, arriving 10 minutes to an hour later. Four or five tsunami waves may hit in succession, traveling thousands of miles to menace distant shores.</p> <p>Sunday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake occurred in an area about 125 miles off the west coast of Sumatra that is marked by a deep trench.</p> <p>Based on clues found among the area's coral reefs and along its beaches, scientists know this is the fourth giant earthquake to strike the same fault zone, known as the Sumatran subduction zone, since 1797.</p> </blockquote> <br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
