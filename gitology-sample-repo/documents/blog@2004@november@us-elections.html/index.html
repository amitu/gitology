<br /> <br />In a <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2004/10/29/203148/79/36?mode=alone;showrate=1#36">comment</a> on <span style="font-style:italic;">"Why this Michael Moore Fan wants Bush to Win"</span> at <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a>, someone says: 
<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">Your film has clearly already done an enormous amount to wake up "middle America" to the fact that they are sleepwalking towards a Police State. I fear, however, that a narrow Democrat victory will not provide the necessary mandate to roll that repressive tendency back under the stone from which it emerged. I fear that the only way you - as a Nation - will exorcise that demon permanently is to let the religious right and its conservative supporters impose the kind of total control over society which appears to give them wet dreams. Then, when the next 9-11 happens and kills twice as many Americans despite the burgeoning Police State and despite the overarching alleged Security; only then will middle America understand that the repressive approach is just as disastrous as the complacency which allowed the first attack. Only then will they begin to understand that Security which impinges on Liberty is utterly self defeating. And only then will we see enough Americans remembering that they are supposed to be the "Land of the Free" and turning on their puppet masters to tear them limb from limb (metaphorically, of course).</span></blockquote> <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism_(United_States)">NeoCons</a> have won. <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan Gillmore's eJournal</a> has another interesting <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010986.shtml#010986">rant</a>.
