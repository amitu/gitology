A <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/firefox-tip/force-links-to-open-in-the-background-263940.php">handy tip</a> from lifehacker:

Google Reader seems pretty neat, but it's always bugged me that using the "v" key to view a link opens that link in a new tab. I usually like to browse all feed items, open interesting links in the background, and then view the opened links [all at once].
</p>
<p>
In order to force all links that open in a new window to load in a background tab, type about:config in the URL bar and change browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground to true. While you're at it, be sure to grab some other Firefox tweaks, too. Thanks, J! â€” Kyle Pott

First thing I needed after installing a fresh firefox. Firefox 3 Alpha seems stable enough for my purpose, and uses lesser RAM than Firefox 2.
