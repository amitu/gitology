<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>I have been using <a href="http://www.furl.net/getStarted.jsp">furl</a> for quite some time now, and never used <a href="http://del.icio.us/doc/about">del.icio.us</a> before yesterday, thought it was generally over hyped. What it really is: it lets you create a login, and store the pages you comeacross, on their site as bookmarks. Furl also does it, but del.icio.us additionally lets you put tags on them. Another minor yet important feature is in del.icio.us you wont get duplicates if you "furled" it twice or more. This was my biggest problem with furl, infact I would never be able to decide if I have already furled it or not. Both <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/upadhyay">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/upadhyay/rss.xml">furl</a> provide RSS feeds [del.icio.us more organised as there are feeds for each tags too], but one thing that I am yet to find an equivalent of in del.icio.us that I liked in furl was <a href="http://www.furl.net/faq.jsp#howShare">daily email</a> of furled items of people you are subscribed too. I already have <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/upadhyay">60 or so RSS feeds</a>, and I have become wary of adding new ones, information over load, so these emails acts as a push, and work well atleast for me. Important thing is to get only one mail per day for any number of subscriptions.<br /><br />I guess the reason I switched to del.icio.us is tags, plus since it has an <a href="http://del.icio.us/doc/api">open API</a>, people have created a <a href="http://pchere.blogspot.com/2005/02/absolutely-delicious-complete-tool.html">platohora of application around it</a>, which adds to its coolness. What about <a href="http://www.furl.net/search?id=upadhyay&amp;count=175000&amp;search=browse">my 175 furled items</a>?
