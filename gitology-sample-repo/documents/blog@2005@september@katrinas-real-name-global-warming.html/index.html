<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>According to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/08/30/katrinas_real_name/">Boston Globe</a>:<br /><blockquote>In July, when the worst drought on record triggered wildfires in Spain and Portugal and left water levels in France at their lowest in 30 years, the explanation was global warming.   <p>When a lethal heat wave in Arizona kept temperatures above 110 degrees and killed more than 20 people in one week, the culprit was global warming.</p> <p>And when the Indian city of Bombay (Mumbai) received 37 inches of rain in one day -- killing 1,000 people and disrupting the lives of 20 million others -- the villain was global warming.</p> <p>As the atmosphere warms, it generates longer droughts, more-intense downpours, more-frequent heat waves, and more-severe storms.</p> <p>Although Katrina began as a relatively small hurricane that glanced off south Florida, it was supercharged with extraordinary intensity by the relatively blistering sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The consequences are as heartbreaking as they are terrifying.</p> <p>Unfortunately, very few people in America know the real name of Hurricane Katrina because the coal and oil industries have spent millions of dollars to keep the public in doubt about the issue.</p> <p>The reason is simple: To allow the climate to stabilize requires humanity to cut its use of coal and oil by 70 percent. That, of course, threatens the survival of one of the largest commercial enterprises in history.</p> </blockquote> </p><p>Sensationalistic journalism? Maybe. Totally disconnected from reality?
