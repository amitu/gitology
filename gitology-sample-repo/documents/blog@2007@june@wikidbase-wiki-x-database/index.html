Came across this interesting project, <a href="http://www.nickblundell.org.uk/projects/wikidbase/">wikidBASE</a>. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Wikidbase is a powerful and highly-flexible combination of two structural extremes of data management systems: a <strong>wiki</strong> and a <strong>database</strong>. As such, wikidbase has:
<ul>
    <li> all of the <strong>flexibility of a wiki</strong> (e.g. any kind of unstructured data can be stored) </li>
    <li> and the <strong>structural data capabilities of a database</strong> (e.g. data may be modelled similarly to database fields, tables and relations such that structural reports can me made of that data). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The functionality of a wiki and a database is combined in such a way that this general-purpose data management system may be shaped easily (without the need of expensive database experts) into a custom data management application (e.g. a contact relation management (CRM) system, a knowledge base, a shared calendar system, a project management system, etc.)

I have always been a fan of <a href="http://www.amitu.com/blog/2005/march/software-recommendation-keynote.html">keynote</a>,  for my personal note taking, but there are times I wanted to have some way to store structural data. Things like "personal movie/book log" are rather structural, title of the book/movie, date-time I watched/read it, my notes about the book/movie if any, rating? etc. I am still not willing to give up Keyonote's trees and tabs and easy formatting abilities to move to a web based wiki, but this tool has made me think about it.
