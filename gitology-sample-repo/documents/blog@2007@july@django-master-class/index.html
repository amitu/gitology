If I have to call a piece of documentation: &quot;mind blowing&quot;, <a href="http://toys.jacobian.org/presentations/2007/oscon/tutorial/" target="_blank">this</a>  has to be it. You do any kind of web programming, you must read this. If you do django, you will know what all you can do, if not you will know what all can be done in a thought-out framework, and start considering switching or implementing part of it in your own. <a href="http://toys.jacobian.org/presentations/2007/oscon/tutorial/" target="_blank">Read it now</a>.
