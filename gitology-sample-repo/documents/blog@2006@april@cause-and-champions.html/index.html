<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Was just reading <a href="http://youthcurry.blogspot.com/2006/04/actor-to-activist.html">Rashmi</a> on the recently in news <a href="http://www.narmada.org/">Narmada Bachao Andolan</a>, found this bit interesting:<br /><blockquote>Aamir's appeal is "rehabilitate them properly". Which is what the Supreme Court has decreed. It is what the NBA of 2006 is also asking for, although in the past it opposed big dams on principle. Now perhaps this opposition was based on sound reasons but as far as the thirsty people of 4 Gujarat and city dwellers like me were concerned, NBA appeared to be 'anti progress'.<br /><br />And therefore, as time went by, Medha Patkar got embedded into our consciousness as a 'troublemaker'. What she was making trouble about - exactly - was never completely clear. Again it could be the complexity of the issue or my lack of receptiveness or the inability of NBA to <a target="_new" href="http://www.dams.org/report/reaction/reaction_nba.htm">communicate it</a> effectively.</blockquote><br />I keep on saying to people, if you are supporting a cause, your biggest enemy might just be the other supporters of the cause. Democracy is a bullshit, there is no power in numbers, people are not fools, truth prevails. If one of the supporters of the cause you are supporting becomes too vocal, many things happen, that supporter may become the representative, just because they are vocal, and if they are assholes, they will go down and put a permanent spot on your cause. You lose with you enemy hundread times, and you still can go on with fight, your supports supporting you all the more, you lose once with your brother, your whole support base splits up. Other things happen too, for example, what is Medha Patekar but for NBA? All the attention she is getting. Who would not want to hear "<a href="http://akshargram.com/nirantar/0805/samvaad?PHPSESSID=c27d003b22c801045d8a7c81dd62a8a8">&#2350;&#2375;&#2343;&#2366; &#2340;&#2375;&#2332;&#2364;&#2340;&#2352;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2352;, &#2360;&#2366;&#2361;&#2360;&#2368; &#2324;&#2352; &#2360;&#2361;&#2344;&#2358;&#2368;&#2354; &#2310;&#2306;&#2342;&#2379;&#2354;&#2344;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2368; &#2352;&#2361;&#2368; &#2361;&#2376;&#2306;&#2404;</a>" about them. Every movement has supporters, some religious like one of my room mates, supporters know movements require money, who do they give money to but the champions? She might like the attention if she is not taking direct advantage of the money. I have nothing against her, no proofs, but I do know it is hard to not make it a personal cause, and get into the situation where someone's point of view must prevail, and there is very little guiding this personal point of view to be in sync with the larger cause they are championing. There are other problems, if a cause has a champion, other sympaths sit down thinking the champion is doing their job. The original champion might consider an ego issue to see a new champion emerge, and possible doubt the original champions modus operandi. There is more that happens. If I support a cause, and see the champion making mistakes, and if I try to tell them they are wrong, I will have to use public media. If the enemy of the cause know that I am publicly critisizing the champion of the cause depite being a support of a cause, the enemy will use this against the cause. Then again if champion makes a mistake, lets say in their argument, enemy will use it against the whole cause.<br /><br />Veda says passion is the biggest enemy of truth. A selfless, egoless, passionless persuit to the truth is the only way to get it. As soon as a person gets associated with the truth, you can say goodbye to the truth.<br /><br />Consider this, I have been hearing about Narmada movement since years, if not decades. Medha Patekar has been there since the beginning(?), and yet, the biggest thing they are supporting: "rehabilitate them properly", becomes shadowed compared to Medha Patekar. Enviorenment concern is a concern, but unless some env scientist shows me a report specifically giving some estimates about the how long before the dam will break down, or what would be the enviorenmental impact of this if all the affected are suitably rehabilitated; how can one consider it credible. <br /><br />No one has the right on land, government can take your land whenever they deem fit (in India), and all you are entitled to is suitable compensation, possible rehab. Supreme court is with NBA on this. Every supporter I know of NBA says that is the bottom line. And yet the strongest theme, that would have gotten the strongest support, and silenced all the opponents had been compromised by enviorenmental cause and other bullshit. I am sorry, I am with the peoples right, but hoarish tendency of trying to accumulate as many sympathy points as possible, that Medha Pathkar deemed the way to go about this issue, has diluted thier stand in front of Indian population at large, lead to lot of confusion, and is the reason all the people to suffer if they did. If the champions is incompetent, the cause can slip away.</p><p>I am not a "leftist" [quoting Rashmi: by leftist type I mean people who raise question marks but do not provide alternative solutions], so here is the solution, not for or against NBA, but for how to fight incase you are for the NBA: find out the number of people who would be affected. As per <a href="http://www.narmada.org/sardarsarovar.html">www.narmada.org</a> sardar sarovar dam alone would displace 1 million people. Scrap the current narmada.org site main page, go out and varify the credibility of this figure, and get people to acknowledge it. Put the names of the people if possible. Make sure everyone talking in favor NBA is either talking about "the number of people displaced and demanding govt to either do proper rehab for them or scrap the dam" or is considered the enemy of your cause. Medha Patekar: Be serious, do the homework, or sit at home and enjoy the movies, a half hearted effort out of sympathy only hurts.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
