<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>I am a fan of the <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2005/10/ning-my-thoughts.html">idea ning stands for</a>, but have <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2006/02/ning-would-they-get-it-this-time.html">found them lacking</a> in what I consider very important aspect. <br /><br />Here is my roughly what is going on in my mind:<br /><br />Data belongs to users.<br /><br />... but managed by original application.<br /><br />In this scenario, the application that created the data is the "manager" of that data. Each data has a manager_id which is set to the creator.<br /><br />Remove the concept of local vs cross application queries and everything is ning query so to say.<br /><br />Lets say I, am trying to create an application MyAjaxBookshelf based on data of Bookshelf. I get immediate read access to the data.<br /><br />How about write operations:  MyAjaxBookshelf does not know if the data was created using it only or by Bookshelf. When it tries to modify the data created/managed by some other application, ning intercepts this call.<br /><br />Ning prompts the user:<blockquote>MyAjaxBookShelf is trying modify data which was created by Bookshelf and owned by you, <a href="#">here is the page on bookshelf<span style="display: none;"><b>Ning Application Compatibility with Bookshelf</b><br /><ul><li>CSSNannyBookShelf: Not compatible at all, they try to convert every image to CSS contraptions.</li><li>MyAJAXBookShelf: These people at Google, I tell you, now who would use our crappy Bookshelf, <i>completely compatible with us</i></li><li>ChineseBookShelf: just like us, but censored. If you allow them any access, they will completely delete books they do not like, don't use it!</li></ul></span></a> that talks about its data compatibility with other applications, and <a href="#">this perticular page<span style="display: none;"><b>MyAJAXBookShelf Compatibility with Bookshelf</b><br />completely compatible with us</span></a> is about what Bookshelf developers think about MyAjaxBookShelf.<br /><br />FYI: This operation was allowed by 927 users and rejected by 32 users so far. Last 5 operations are [ADAAA].<br /><br />Do you want to allow this?<br />( o) Yes,<br />(   ) No,<br />(   ) Yes but please make checkpoint first.<br /><br />[X] remember my answer for every data write access by MyAjaxBookshelf when it is owned by Bookshelf<br />[X] remember my answer for every data write access by MyAjaxBookshelf<br />[X] remember my answer for any foreign app data write access when it is managed by Bookshelf</blockquote></p><p>What do you think ning?</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
