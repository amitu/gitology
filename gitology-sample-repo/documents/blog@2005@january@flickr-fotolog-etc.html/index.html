In response, the Fotolog staff has adopted the standard solution - limit the number of posts that can be made using the free service to control bandwidth and storage costs, and institute a paid Gold membership for people who want more serious usage.</blockquote> <br />Interesting, but then can you explain <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, as despite its Pro membership, its quite a hit? <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/">MANY 2 MANY</a> <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/12/22/notes_from_itp_flickraswebservices_edition.php">can</a>:
