They have decided to go for a mix of english terms and arcane/correct hindi terms. They should be using "Anya kriyaen" instead of "Aur kriyaen", similerly in the drop down for "more actions" they should use &#2340;&#2366;&#2352;&#2366;&#2306;&#2325;&#2367;&#2340;, &#2309;&#2340;&#2366;&#2352;&#2366;&#2306;&#2325;&#2367;&#2340; "karen" insted of "joden" that they use right now. Also "contact" verb means "&#2360;&#2306;&#2346;&#2352;&#2381;&#2325; karen" where as its used as noun in the interface, so it should be something I can't recall right now! Will get <a href="http://nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com/2005/01/blogging-in-hindi-howto.html">yudit</a> and file a support request with Google sometime about it. <br /><br />PS: Stupid flickr gives you preview option for writing comments on photos, but not while composing a blog entry!<br clear="all" /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
