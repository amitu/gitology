<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>I love <a href="http://www.flickr.com/badge_new.gne">Flickr Badges</a>, you can see one in my blog's sidebar, and recently switched from their HTML badge that showed randomly selected 4 or 5 photos to its Flash incarnation that keeps on showing random images. I have some 800 photos on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upadhyay/">my Flickr</a> account, and most of them remind me some memories, and this is the reason I use badge. It also presents my visitors some glimpses from my life that I conisdered not too private. The decision to switch was governed by the fact that I will be able to view more than 4-5 random pictures. I guess the desigers of Flick badge are aware of this use case and something is drastically wrong with them if they are not, and anyone without much thought can arrive at the conclusion that if that is the requirement, the selection of images should be decently randomized, so other than animating some images, they had just one requirement, and yet after getting millions of dollars from Yahoo!, they decided its okay for them not to meet even that. I mean how hard it is not to realize that they are picking pictures from only my latest 10-20% or so with maximum waitage on the latest ones, and this only happens in their Flash badge, HTML badge was quite random.  </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
