<br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:100%;"><b></b></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">free healthcare frightens me...</span> <br /> <span style="font-style: italic;"> <br />...as a libertarian. Because "free" actually means "paid for by taxes", which means the individual has less control over the cost (no competition) and quality of care received (doctors don't have to compete).</span> <br /> <br />Here is the summary of the debate that follows.
<br /><span class="fullpost"> <br /><a href="http://slashdot.org/%7Eanethema">anathema</a> <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=127726&amp;cid=10671186">gives</a> the example of Canada, which has free health care for all:
<br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">I think the best and worst thing about canadian health professionals is they are immune to civil lawsuits. </span><span style="font-style: italic;"> <br /></span> <br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">This is great because they dont need malpractice insurance..keeps costs much lower.
<br /> </span></li> <br /><li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">This is terrible because while they are technically answerable to peer review, they are still much more lax and less paranoid in treating/diagnosing patients.
<br /> </span></li> </ul> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">There are people who die from terminal diseases because the doctor only diagnoses a cold or some such. My gf's dad has crohn's disease, and took him forever to get a doctor to run tests because of his severe abdominal pain. They let it go for so long that he had to have a piece of his intestine removed. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">A doctor in the states would be willing to do any test the patient would pay for..not jsut tell him to avoid certain foots, etc.</span> <br /> <br />The debate is at two levels, one about the perils and benefits of the medical lawsuits, highly prevalent in US. Keeps them at toes vs keeps them costly. At the other end the debate is about <span style="font-style: italic;">"the Libertarians believe that the free market can fix any and all problems that could possibly come up"</span> as NightHwk1 <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=127726&amp;cid=10671850">points</a> out.
<br /> <br />A conservative, but rather lame <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=127726&amp;cid=10670927">rebuttal</a> of <span style="font-style: italic;">"low quality of care received (doctors don't have to compete)"</span> argument:
<br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">People who become doctors rarely do it for the money. They typically do it for the love of people and the love of the job. Personally, I prefer it that way -- I'd rather be operated on by someone who wants to be in that profession rather than by someone who is just there for the money, and who will cut whatever corners they can to increase their productivity and bottom line. Wouldn't you?</span> <br /> <br />and then goes on and raises a question:
<br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">If you're one of the ~45 million Americans without health insurance and living near or below the poverty line, you have no "choice" at all. You simply get stuck with little or no health care at all. Where is there any choice in that?</span> <br /> <br />Its slashdot, debates don't get over there, they just happen, but it has raised a few question to think about. Should we go for free health care for all? its not free, paid by taxpayers money, so basically though it helps the poor, it reduces the choices of the ones who happen not to be poor(and the ones who really matter? Its their money after all). And should we support the highly letigious culture in India? its a pandora's box, it will improve so many things, accountability, but it will increase the cost of so many things. For a poor country like ours, should we try to help the poor or try to cut the root causes of what makes us poor?
