<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea">Zeno</a> started it like this:
<br /><blockquote>Achilles and the tortoise decide to have a race. Achilles is known to be the faster runner of the two, and therefore decides to give the tortoise a head start.
<br /> <br />Once the race begins, it is true to say that Achilles will take some time to reach the starting point of the tortoise. During this finite time, it is also true to say that the tortoise will have moved forward by some finite distance, and will therefore still maintain a lead in the race. Achilles will once again take some time to reach the tortoise's new position, during which the tortoise will move forward some distance yet again, thus maintaining his lead.
<br /> <br /> This continues on forever. Therefore Achilles never overtakes the tortoise.</blockquote> <br />But ofcourse everyone knows its boring sum-of-infinite-series crap, not some interesting story involving alians, psychoanalysis and the art of boxing, as K5 would want us to <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/1/5/111446/4154">believe</a> [still good read never-the-less].
<br /> <br />What I like better is the one Vishnu told me about: <span style="font-style: italic;">At anytime a moving arrow occupies exactly the space its surface encloses and no part of this arrow is outside this enclosed space. There is no way any part of the arrow can go out of this space, this is true for all instants of time, and thus motion is a fallacy. </span>Again by Zeno.
