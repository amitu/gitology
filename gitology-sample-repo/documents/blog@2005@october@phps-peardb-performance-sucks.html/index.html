<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>I was working on a PHP application, and decided to use PEAR:DB after reading article at: <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2001/11/29/peardb.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a<wbr>/php/2001/11/29/peardb.html</wbr></a><br /><br />And things went fine till I was done developing and start testing the performance. The article said: <span name="intelliTxt"><br /></span><blockquote><span name="intelliTxt">PEAR::DB certainly has problems and will continue to improve. Many critics of PEAR::DB, such as Manuel Lemos the author of  <i>Metabase</i>, say PEAR::DB is too slow and doesn't provide a true abstraction to the interaction with database servers. I believe the most important part of a database abstraction library is its design -- I want to be able to use a high-quality library on my code; <span style="font-weight: bold;">differences of 0.02% are not so important</span>.</span></blockquote><br />[Emphasis mine]<br /><br />Where as my performance tests gave me:<br /><br /><table><tbody><tr><td> script </td><td> Throughput (Req.s/Sec.)  </td></tr><tr><td> script1.php</td><td> 42<br /></td></tr><tr><td> script2.php </td><td> 563<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Where the script1.php is:<br /><blockquote>getVersion() {<br />return "PHP Soap Server 1.0";<br />}<br /><br />include_once("DB.php ");<br />$server = new SoapServer("api.wsdl");<br />$server->addFunction("getVersio<wbr>n");<br />$server->handle();<br />?><br /></wbr></blockquote><br />and script2.php has the "include_once db.php" line commented out.<br /></p><p>This is an order of magnitude performance drop, not just 0.02 percent, DB.php, as nice it is, and I am sure its being worked on, but as it is, it should not be recommended for any serious application. </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
