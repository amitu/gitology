<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Google recently previewed and pulled off a <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2005/03/google-x.html">Google X</a>. <a href="http://www.queryster.com/">Queryster Directory</a> has launched <a href="http://www.queryster.com/searchx/">Search X</a>, a spoof of that service, but its more than a mere parody, it opens a non intrusive popup, actually we should call it toolbar, when you search something using it, that gives you an option to check result from other search providers from within the search results shown for one search provider. They should add the zoom effect on the toolbar, and a lineedit to modify the query string. And if they dont, someone should write a Firefox extension to do it. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
