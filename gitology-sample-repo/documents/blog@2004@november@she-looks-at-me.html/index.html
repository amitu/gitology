<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>She looks at me
<br />when I go past her
<br />She looks at me
<br />when she enters the room
<br />or leaves
<br /> <br />She looks at me
<br />and searches me 
<br />when she can't
<br />She looks at me
<br />when I flirt with a girl next to her
<br />And then looks at me
<br />when I take her for coffee
<br />and when we come back.
<br /> <br />I don't look at her
<br />as that would be a sin
<br />If I don't then go ahead
<br />and hold her hands
<br />and promise her never to leave her, ever.
<br />And do that.
<br /> <br />So I look down
<br />when she goes past me
<br />I can't give her what she wants
<br />I look at somebody too.
