<br /><h3><a title="Site: retroBlogs" href="http://www.retrolabs.com/retroblogs/2005/01/im-on-skype.php" target="_top"></a></h3> <blockquote> <h3><a title="Site: retroBlogs" href="http://www.retrolabs.com/retroblogs/2005/01/im-on-skype.php" target="_top">I'm on skype</a></h3> <p class="author">By rahul</p> Yesterday I finally downloaded and used <a href="http://www.skype.com/" target="_top" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Skype</a>. And even though I had to speak to <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay" target="_top" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Upadhyay</a> only (no one else on my list), who was in the same room, both of us were chanting <i>disruptive! disruptive!!</i> after using it. You read about it, you even <a href="http://www.retrolabs.com/retroblogs/2004/07/skype-introduces-skypeout.php" target="_top" class="blines2" title="Link to another page in this blog">blog</a> about it, but it still manages to surprise you when you use it - that's Skype.
<br /> <br />Voice clarity was superb, lot better than the call quality from US on cellphone. Lag was zero, which could be due to other reasons also, but still.
<br /> <br />I'm going crazy about it. I'm dialing <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/11/22/skype_echo_test_service.html" target="_top" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">echo123</a> and listening my own voice. ;)
<br /> <br />And now you can even <a href="callto://n8d10021" target="_top" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog"><img src="http://goodies.skype.com/graphics/skypeme_btn_blue.gif" style="border: 0px none ; padding: 0px;" /></a>.</blockquote> <br />For starters, Skype is "Free Internet telephony that just works!". Get it <a href="http://www.skype.com/download/">here</a>, works on Linux etc too, and claims to work with proxies, haven't tested tho.
