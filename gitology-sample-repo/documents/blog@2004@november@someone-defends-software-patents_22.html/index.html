<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Exactly as I would have <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/11/20/2321.aspx">wished</a> him to:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote>Personally, I don't believe software patents are a good idea. I realize that algorithms lie in that grey area between a mechanical process (which is patentable) and an abstract idea (which is not), but at a purely practical level I think that software patents generally do much more harm than good. As such, I'd like to see them go away and the US patent office focus on more productive tasks. I have nothing but contempt for any company that tries to use patents to achieve what they could not through purely competitive means. This includes Microsoft, should they ever choose to do so or have they ever chosen to do so. (I'm not aware of any such situation, but I'm hardly omniscient.)
<br /> <br />However, software patents do exist. So while the good fight goes on to get rid of them, I also believe that it would be dangerously naive to not play the game as best we can in the meantime in as principled a way as possible. There are a lot of people who would love nothing more than to just take a piece out of Microsoft either because they can or because they want to get rich and not for any better reason than that. I've been around long enough to see the kind of trouble that patents can cause us, and so I believe the best defense is a good offense. While I don't believe in using patents in an unprovoked way, I do believe in having a robust patent arsenal with which to defend ourselves should someone get it in their head that they want to hold our products hostage for money or just to cause trouble.</blockquote></span> <br />I reckon this is the strongest non evil argument in favor of software patents. Those who are "infected" are "suffering", lets not let the "disease" spread to the rest.
