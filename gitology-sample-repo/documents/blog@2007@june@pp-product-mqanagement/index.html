A gem of an idea in that post includes the concept of "strong opinions weakly held". [<a href="http://heyrg.wordpress.com/">RG</a> points to the <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html">source</a>]:

<blockquote>
<p>
to deal with an uncertain future and still move forward – they advise people to have “strong opinions, which are weakly held.” ... weak opinions are problematic because people aren’t inspired to develop the best arguments possible for them, or to put forth the energy required to test them. ... it is just as important, however, to not be too attached to what you believe because, otherwise, it undermines your ability to “see” and “hear” evidence that clashes with your opinions.
