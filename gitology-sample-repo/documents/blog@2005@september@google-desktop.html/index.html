Bloglines is one thing, I used to subscribe to feeds from regular news sites hoping to read them, but the volume used to be too high to keep up with. Google Desktop has a peculiar TV like news display, latest 10-12 news items keep scrolling. <br /><br />Another thing that stops me from using the autohide feature is the Photos widget. Its a pleasure to see the photos from old times scrolling every so often. A minimal but functional ToDo pane is also very useful. <br /><br />Incidentally I have almost never used its search, Ctrl-E/firefox search box is still my preferred way of searching. Google also acknowledges this by renaming Google Desktop Search to Google Desktop.<br clear="all" /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
