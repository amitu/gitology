<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across <a href="http://atulchitnis.net/diary/showentry/288">this</a> on <a href="http://atulchitnis.net/">Atul Chitnis</a>' blog: <blockquote>David Hammerstein, a Member of the European Parliament, has sent a letter to the Indian government on the subject of software patents. <p> Will this make India see sense? Will it stop India from sending its "pride of the nation" industry into a complete hell that it has been safe from till now? </p> <p> Stay tuned for the next gripping episode of "a country commits intellectual suicide", coming soon to a browser near you.   </p> <p> For now, here is the letter:   </p> <p> <i>To<br />Mr. T.K. VISWANATHAN Secretary to Government of India,<br />Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, Leader of the Indian National Congress, 10, Janpath,<br />Dr. Manmohan Singh Prime Minister of India<br />Shri Kamal Nath Minister for Commerce & Industry<br />L K Advani Leader of Opposition </i></p> <p> <i>David Hammerstein Member of the European Parliament Grupo Verde/ALE </i></p> <p> <i>Subject: Software patents in the Parliaments of Europe and India </i></p> <p> <i>Dear fellow MP, </i></p> <p> <i>I am writing to you on the subject of software patents as Member of European Parliament. The European Parliament has opposed to make software patentable in September 2003, and in February 2005 the European Parliament by unanimous vote rejected a proposal by the Council of the European Union to request that. The debate is still open here, but speaking as a Parlamentarian I urge you to avoid any hasty and unwise steps in India. </i></p> <p> <i>During our debate, the US trade representative (for example in a letter of 16 September 2003) has argued that Europe was bound to have software patents due to the TRIPS treaty. We have now reached the understanding that in the making of TRIPS there is no indication that computer programs were to seen as a field of technology in the sense of TRIPS. Hence we clarified in Article 2 of our directive: "(2) The use of natural forces to control physical effects beyond the digital representation of information belongs to a field of technology. The processing, handling, and presentation of information do not belong to a field of technology, even where technical devices are employed for such purposes". </i></p> <p> <i>This is in accordance with art 52 (2)(c) of the European Patent Convention that states clearly that "schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers" shall not be regarded as inventions. </i></p> <p> <i>Moreover, article 10 of the TRIPs treaty also clearly demands protection by copyright for computer programs; TRIPS does not mention patent protection for computer programs at any place. </i></p> <p> <i>Given that the majority of software patent applications at the European Patent Office is from US and Japanese countries, having software patentable is clearly not in Europe's interest, and it is also likely also not to be in India's interest. </i></p> <p> <i>I would recommend either<br /></i></p> <ul> <i><br /></i><li>to amend the Indian law in the sense as outlined at <a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/InAmend0503En" target="new">http://wiki.ffii.org/InAmend0503En</a> <p> </p></li><li>or just to keep the acceptable present wording of the Patent Act's 2002 version "3 (k) a mathematical or business method or computer programme per se or algorithms" and to reject the ambiguous wording that has it had been issued by the Minister of Industry Kamal Nath in December 2004 ordinance "3 (k) a computer programme per se other than its technical application to industry or a combination with hardware; 3(ka) a mathematical method or business method or algorithms;" <p> </p></li><li>or to improve the present wording of the Patent Act's 2002 version by simply deleting "per se" in "3(k) a mathematical or business method or computer programme per se or algorithms"<br /></li> </ul> <i><br />With kind regards,   </i> <p> <i>David Hammerstein</i> </p> <p> Taken from <a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/Hammerstein050321En" target="new">http://wiki.ffii.org/Hammerstein050321En</a> </p> </blockquote><br />I have talked about software patents in the past too, especially this <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2004/11/note-on-india-and-ipr.html">note</a>, and <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2004/12/more-on-software-patents.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2004/12/more-on-software-patents.html">here</a>. I will just quote <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002291.shtml">Bill Gates on software patents</a>:<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote>If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented and had taken out patents, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the industry would be at a complete standstill today</span>. The solution . . . is patent exchanges . . . and patenting as much as we can. . . . A future start-up with no patents of its own will be forced to pay whatever price the giants choose to impose. That price might be high: Established companies have an interest in excluding future competitors.</blockquote></span><br />Delhi Linux User Group has compiled a <a href="http://lug-delhi.org/SoftwarePatentFAQ">FAQ</a> on it.<br /><br />The real question is not software patents are good or bad, but are they good or bad for <span style="font-weight: bold;">India Right Now</span>. On the minus we would limit a lot of people to do things, make a lot of people criminals. Government is granting people monopoly, one day in parliament costs couple of crores of Rupees, one law requires tens of crores more to complete the process once approved by parliament, then something of this magnitude, that is potentially going to make half of computer using population criminals is going to require thousands of crores to inforce if it is to be done effectively, I just want to see some studies that says they are worth it, that at the end of the day, in economic terms, India is going to profit from it. I havent seen one yet, though I have seen many like <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1023059,prtpage-1.cms">this</a>.<br /><br />A good resouce to follow software patent related news in India is <a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/SwpatinEn">here</a>. <br /> <br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
