Pretty interesting idea in fact, foreigners have problems with local language, and a PDA can be packed with travel guidelines, translation programs, audio and video instructions to reach places and all. In fact the translator software can also speak out in local languages saving the poor visitor exercising his vocal skills. With images and video, tourists will get much better idea of what to expect on all the possible tourist spots and can make more informed decisions. Hyperlink nature of digital content and facility to search makes it orders of magnitude more useful for documentation than paper pamphlets. And if the cost of PDA is a concern they can allot it based on Passport and collect it when the tourists leave the country. Should save the PDA from becoming extinct I guess.
