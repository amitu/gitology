<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Somehow in India democracy takes a weird turn in the form of mob mentality, you have an accident in a busy small town road, hit a local, very likely your car will be burnt, you will be beaten up or worse could happen. Yesterday I read about some story in newspaper, a woman, her husband and child were burnt alive in some place because woman allegedly killed some kid. The evidence that she actually did kill that kid were recovered much later, but the mob had pronounced their judgment and carried the executed much already. Somehow a group of people will just decide what should happen in the name of morals or ethics or anything they feel like, and do anything, burn valentine's day card shops, movie theaters, attack people personally, and their family or anyone they can get their hands on. Is it only limited to villegers and the <a href="http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=58616">religious zealots</a>? <a href="http://youthcurry.blogspot.com/2005/12/ethics-of-mbas.html">apparently education doesn't help much</a> either, though they are not out their burning people, these guys have opinion like:<br /><blockquote><em></em><em>I suggest IIMs and alumni collectively should take the lead in denouncing this guy (and any other alumnus caught doing such things or worse)... take back the degree, etc. </em><br /></blockquote>or,<br /><blockquote>I don't know what the IIM 'community' can do to punish Vivek Prakash.</blockquote></p><p>I am pretty sure leave ten or twenty of more vocal of these guys in a room with the Vivek Prakash person, they would beat him up, and probably much more for being "<strong>A blot on us all</strong>".</p><p>How about this lesson on ethics: leave them alone, and let the police and judiciary do the job. If you don't believe in police and judiciary, tell yourself twenty times a day that "you do not believe in Indian police and judiciary", and do something about <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>. Don't organize groups and go after individuals just because someday not much is on on TV.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
