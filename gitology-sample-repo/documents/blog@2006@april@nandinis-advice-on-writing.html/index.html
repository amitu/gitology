<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>She has been having a Ask Me Anything Day, <a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com/2006/03/its-ask-me-anything-day_31.html">provides the answers</a>, here is mine:<br /><blockquote><i><b>Sometimes I get really cool idea, and I can talk for hours about them with people in person, but the moment I sit down on the computer, I become completely blank, will hardly write one or two sentence and realize this is all I had to say. What do I do, how do I begin. Have written 30 page letters full lenght page love letters to girlfriends before, tho. Any suggestions?</b></i> (<a href="profile/1334855">Amit</a>)<br /><br />30 page letters....! Shit, give some pointers to Saurabh, will you?<br /><br />Here's my theory: all cool ideas can be expressed in one sentence. Explanations are only necessary if there is a disagreement or a failure to <i>understand</i> it - i.e. a failure to see how the idea is applicable in life.<br /><br />Example: the God question, above. The idea that I have is simple - God doesn't exist. What else is there to say about it? Nothing, unless somebody says, "no, dude, God exists, look, He created the universe, isn't that proof?" Then you explain why that can't be. Or somebody'll say, "So what if God doesn't exist?", to which you can launch into a rant about how it's important for people to stop believing in God, because trusting in fiction does a lot of harm.<br /><br />All the movies you've seen, the books you've read, have a one-sentence idea behind them. The movie or the book is an attempt to get the audience to <i>understand</i> the idea by showing how it's applicable to real people. The understanding only happens when the idea is repeatedly tested by antagonistic people and situations, and is <i>shown</i> to be true. (Think of it this way: a movie without any conflict would <i>suck</i>.)<br /><br />So the next time you want to write, play Devil's Advocate to your idea. Think what the nay-sayers would say. Then blast them to smithereens. It's crazy fun.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Interesting. Soon after asking her this question I realize one of the biggest problem in writing for me is who am I writing it for. That girlfriend letter thing, I can write quite much as I knew how she thinks, but when I am writing for this blog for example, I am not too sure. But she is right about the devils advocacy bit, that can give some opportunities to write. </p><br />So why do I have like a million blogs? Well I was aiming for a gazillion, but fell short by a few I guess :-P.<br /><p>And Nandini, please do yourself a favor and use <a href="http://www.labelr.com/">labelr</a> :-)</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
