It must be like reading an Iraqi blog during the war years.<br /><br />Apart from the side-taking, I find it very interesting how an iron curtain has developed between MS-crowd and OSS-crowd. Even in other companies there are MCSEs and MCSDs on one hand who insist<nobr> <wbr></wbr></nobr>.NET is the future, and the not-so-well-dressed OSS crowd. Working on cheaper hardware, trying always to run their latest game on gentoo.<br /><br />Its a war of Nerds vs Geeks. The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Regardless of all bias, both sides are fully functional, both producing products and distributing it to the world. Somehow it does remind me of the cold war days, MS being the USSR simply because its closed, considered sinister, has a big arsenal, and has citizens who want to emigrate.<br /><br />Different people enjoy working different places. I always enjoy work when I know I'll get paid for it. I also sometimes enjoy starting little OSS projects, my pet projects that I very excruciatingly design, plan, and start... just for the kicks and to see if I can make something better, but most of which die before beta. At work, we use both OSS and commercial OSes and software. Both philosophies are at war in every quarter, and despite what the slashdot (or microsoft) crowd might think, right now neither group has the overwhelming strength. Thats why so many companies HAVE to run a linux/BSD firewall, and a windows domain controller. Sure I can run a samba domain controller, but in some ways (beside security) its like running a Windows 2000 professional firewall.<br /><br />I wouldnt mind working at Redhat AND at Microsoft. Given the options, I'll choose whichever pays me more. I suspect I'll hate the work at MS, because I'm biased, have been since 96 when I tried slackware 3.0. Theres also a kind of an addictive nomadic freedom related to opensource programming, which occasionally makes up for the lack of $$$.<br /><br />I dont think Microsoft will disappear, just as I dont think the x86 architecture will disappear. There are far too many games for me that arent ported to Linux or MacOS. There are far too many applications that require win32 API to run, and running them in WINE makes em less stable not more. The whole reason why Microsoft is bigger than Apple, is why Microsoft will stick around... but Linux will certainly come of age. This competition is bound to intensify.<br /><br />I love Linux. It probably will not make one man extremely rich, but it will not only bring more freedom, yet complexity to desktops, it will also bring with it BSD and all other OSes which never had the chance before. Linux actually is a favor to Solaris and MacOS. Currently theyre competitors of sorts, but Linux will make portable applications the fashion. The huge source base that Linux and BSD have created will all run perfectly on both OSX and Solaris and the rest, giving them life (would you rather run Netscape 4.75 or Firefox 1.0 on AIX?), think of the free databases we now have.<br /><br />As much as we love to bash Microsoft and hope Linux will be the saviour, too many of us still log onto slashdot from our Windows machines, to bash Microsoft. We've only paid hard cash to Microsoft.<br /></td></tr> <tr><td> <span style="font-size:85%;">      [ <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=139183&amp;op=Reply&amp;threshold=3&amp;commentsort=1&amp;tid=109&amp;tid=1&amp;mode=nested&amp;pid=11648439">Reply to This</a>  | <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=139183&amp;threshold=3&amp;commentsort=1&amp;tid=109&amp;tid=1&amp;mode=nested&amp;cid=11647948">Parent</a>  | <select name="reason_11648439"><option value="0">Normal</option><option value="1">Offtopic</option><option value="2">Flamebait</option><option value="3">Troll</option><option value="4">Redundant</option><option value="5">Insightful</option><option value="6">Interesting</option><option value="7">Informative</option><option value="8">Funny</option><option value="9">Overrated</option><option value="10">Underrated</option></select> ]      </span> </td></tr> </tbody> </table> <ul> <li><span style="font-size:85%;"><b><a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=139183&amp;threshold=-1&amp;commentsort=1&amp;tid=109&amp;tid=1&amp;mode=nested&amp;pid=11648439">2 replies</a>  beneath your current threshold.</b></span></li> </ul> </blockquote>Has this guy found a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/">portal</a> to my brain?!<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
