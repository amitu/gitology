<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Today I noticed this while reading mail on my gmail account: I had three ads on the side related to Soap and Softwares used to debug Soap applications, but my mail thread did not have *anything* to do with Soap at all!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/gmail-soap.PNG"><center><img src="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/gmail-small-soap.PNG" style="border: 0px none ; padding: 0px;" /></center></a><br />But out of my 186MB of mails at GMail, I have only 26 conversations that talk about soap, more than half of them talking about caffinated soap! So how come Google knew that I am into soap? Yesterday I searched for and went on a gazillion sites about soap!<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/history-soap.PNG" style="border: 0px none ; padding: 0px;" /></center><br />Thanks to Google ads, Google is in an unique position today, it not only knows everything I searched, or mailed about, it also knows every page I went to. Well atleast the one that has Google ads on them [which given their ubiquitous nature, I am sure nearly every other page I visit have]. But till before this I used to think those data are not linked to my email address and they dont have a profile on me! Looks like they do. Creepy.<br /><br />PS: <a href="http://fly.hiwaay.net/%7Epspoole/echelon.html">Echelon</a>.<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
