<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>I learned riding motor-cycle not very long time ago, mostly from my brother. We keep on having argument about my "habit" of pulling clutches while slowing down the bike, he maintains I should not, and just try to adjust gear based on current speed, otherwise the bike will skid. My "philosophy" is I will engage the engine only when I want to accelerate, as if I am applying brakes without pulling clutches I will make the break work against the kinetic energy of the bike as well as the kinetic energy of the engine rotation, not a smart thing to do when you want the bike to stop quickly. Also not disengaging engine when you don't need it lets the engine play a role in the bike dynamics, and under the wrong situation and wrong time it may be, umm, less than desirable. So I was pretty convinced that my strategy is the right one, and his skid theory is "superstitious".<br /><br />Well today I was coming back after watching Starwars Ep. 3, which BTW is quite nice movie despite whatever you might have heard about it, its not easy to make a movie filled with robots and starships and lightspeed travels and jedis and sabers and remote planets and weird creatures and all, so human; when I had to drive on uphill patch of road with lots of muddy water spilled on it, that is always very scary thing for me, which is when I realized the concept of static vs dynamic friction, and everything suddenly made sense. So if you disengage engine ie pull clutch and apply brakes, and if the road is even little bit slippery, the wheel will just freeze, putting the tyre-road friction in the dynamic friction domain from the normal static-friction, resulting in nearly an order of magnitude lesser traction, and thus the skidding, whereas if you don't pull clutches, tyres breaks will have to stop both the engine and tyres, much more difficult to freeze and no skid.<br /><br />My current strategy recommendation: if road is not wet/oily and bike is light, use clutch if emergency stop is required, otherwise don't [if you are a person of habits, just don't]. Do drop in a comment if you think otherwise.<br /><br />Having said that, technology is the best friend in situation like this, every bike should come with anti-skid brakes, and disk brakes, I don't know if they are really a good thing. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
