<br /></p><blockquote><p>Procrastination is the reward for not doing work.</p> <p>If you work hard all year, what can you look forward to? Your vacation. Procrastination is like taking that vacation right now. If you can't take a vacation at the end of a year of hard work, you might as well take it now because there is no reward for finishing your work.</p> <p>When I was in kindergarten I got a letter sent home. I wish I had it framed because it explained so much about my personality for so many years. It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mark doesn't distinguish between work and play. He continues to play when it's time to work, and work when it's time to play.</p> </blockquote> <p>Most books on procrastination will tell you that it's important to separate work from pleasure. That you procrastinate because you don't know when you will be able to take some time to relax, and that by creating clear times where you're not allowed to do work, you give yourself permission to do work at other times.</p> <p>I'd say this is half true. The problem with it is that there's still no clear reason to do the work. If I work 9 to 5, I don't work when I get home, yet much of my day at work is wasted too. Why? Because there is no reward for completing the work. If I complete the work, I'm still at my job, so what incentive do I have? </p> <p>Well, what would Nanny 911 do? She would take away everything you use to procrastinate, and not give it back until you finished your work. No exceptions, because an exception is a random reinforcer.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Procrastination 101 </p> <p>Procrastination is a habit. People aren't born procrastinators or hard workers, it's something you learn, like biting your fingernails. Luckily, it can be unlearned as well. </p> <p>If you study people while they're working, you'll find that a single behavior or set of behaviors predict when you're about to procrastinate. These are like poker tells. Unconscious twitches that signal you're about to stop working. If you can figure out what these behaviors are and remind yourself to get back to work whenever it happens, you can stop the interruptions.</p> <p>These procrastination events come in basically three flavors. The first are events that come to you - the phone ringing, someone knocking on your door, etc. The second are things that depend outside objects, but that you initiate like getting up to go to the candy machine. The third are purely internal events, just zoning out and daydreaming.</p> <p>If you can change your environment to get rid of the distraction, you should do it. Sometimes these environmental variables are more subtle than you realize. A memento on your desk could trigger a pleasant daydream, or a bill could trigger some abstract financial worry. They key here is to recognize when these distractions are tied to objects, and then get rid of those objects.</p></blockquote><p>See blogging even helps learn fight procrastination :P Get back to work <a href="http://www.marktaw.com/getbacktowork.htm">now</a>.
