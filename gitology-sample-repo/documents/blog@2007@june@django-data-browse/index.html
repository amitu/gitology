<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/databrowse/">Data browse</a> was recently added to <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>. Databrowse is an application that creates browse user interface for your database. You don't have to write any code, just have to register the models/tables you want to allow browsing for. It was not obvious to me how it would look like, so I enabled it on my blog, you can browse this blog's post and categories etc <a href="http://www.amitu.com/blog/db/">here</a>. As you can see it is pretty comprehensive view of your database. What about django's <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/beta/chapter06/">admin application</a>? Admin is not very suitable for browsing purpose, and is primarily meant for administration only.
