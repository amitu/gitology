The virus has spread widely among bird populations in Southeast Asia.</p> <p>Dr. Shigeru Omi, the W.H.O.'s regional director for Asia and the Pacific, said that if a pandemic should strike - an outcome he termed "very, very likely" - governments should be prepared to close schools, office buildings and factories to slow the rate of new infections. </p> </blockquote> <p>Though some say this Omi person is just a troll, dear southeast Asians, please beaware, and be selective of the places you eat. Reminds me the last time I ordered chicken, from a quite decent place here (SP), it terned out pretty bad.</p> <br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
