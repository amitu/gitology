<p>Note: I wrote this article few weeks back, and refrained from posting it till I was done with creating <a href="http://somepickle.in" target="_blank">somepickle</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>The quality of comments on Rediff articles is usually pathetic, but there are <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jul/30masjid.htm" target="_blank">exceptions</a>:</p><blockquote><font>by John W Davis on Jul 30, 2007 04:42 PM <span> | <a href="javascript:closereplydiv(&#39;bb0d71c97a62c2b94f3e1ec133d516&#39;);" target="_blank">Hide replies</a></span><br /><br /> Pakistan has given the trainings to people in the name of Islam who carried out the bomb-blasts in Bombay which left more than 400 innocent people dead. <br /> <br />If pakistani government is so much devoted for Islamic cause then why they raided the Red Mosque in Pakistan and killed the Maulvi and all his supporters. <br />- What ISI, pakistan based Jihadi group who fight for the so called cause of Islam, what they were doing at the time of raid on the masjid. <br /> <br />Had this act been done in India of raiding a Masjid, Pakistan must have made a lot of hue and cry so also media. They would have declared India anti-islamic, would have prepared so many provocative videos and would have spreaded them in the name of Islam and prepare the people to carrying out anti-India, terrorist activities and kill innocent people. <br /> <br />Pakistan always try to pose itself &quot;Massiha&quot; of musalmaans and in the name of helping the cause of Islam, pakistan use India Musalmaans for carrying out anti-India and terrorist activites. <br /> <br />Pakistan&#39;s president openly and happily mentioned that they attacked the mosque since China asked to do so (some chinese citizens were made hostage by Red Mosque and later freed). <br />So, if Pakistan is really devoted for Islamic cause, they would not have carried out the attack on the mosque and killing so many people just because China asked them to do so.</font></blockquote><p>No idea how long would the comment stay on that page, Rediff does not have peramalink for individual comments. They also routinely censor comments, not that that sounds as bad given the quality of comments, but a very bad lesson nevertheless. These people should be fighting government censorship, how can they do it now, now that they themselves do it. </p><p>They say media is the eye of a nation, I guess we are pretty much a blind country. </p><p>Just gave me the idea, a <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/" target="_blank">slashcode</a>  based website for India. We are utterly full of contempt against our media, the user comment may prove more informative than the stories themselves. We need a forum for people to speak/argue, and slashcode&#39;s moderation system/user kerma ratings is the best out there.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://somepickle.in" target="_blank">News for Indians, stuff that matters</a>. </p><p>Why not!&nbsp; </p>
