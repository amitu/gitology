Picasa is a very good image management software, available only for Windows until before this. </p> <p></p><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upadhyay/153764328/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/153764328_1c6451dd3d_m.jpg" alt="ubuntu_picasa" height="180" width="240" /></a></center><p></p><p>Google Earth for Linux is <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2006052601026NWSWRL">underway</a>.</p>Why is this such an important news?<br /><br />Microsoft considers Google one of their biggest threat, and their CEO has <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,39020369,39216371,00.htm">'vowed to kill Google'</a>. Google has been rather pro Microsoft in their software offerings till late, though they try their best to cater to their interests in browser market. Things got a little interesting after  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,125718,00.asp">DOJ Rebuffs Complaints About IE 7 Search Box</a>, and looks like Google has decided to go head on with Microsoft. First today Google <a href="http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/4434/937/">announced partnership</a> with Dell to bundle Google  software with PCs. To add to it, Google has decided to do a psychological warfare with Microsoft by supporting Linux for a few of their applications. Linux users should not jump with joy though, as Google stands to gain very little by a gain in Linux users, and this gambit is almost purely for blackmail/extortion [both these applications must have been in the process of porting since some time, just that Google has decided to launch them now to drive shiver through Microsoft]. Also Google almost never announces that they are working on some application before launching it, Google Earth for Linux is their first pre-announcement. Google Earth Linux is supposed to be a rewrite using Qt etc, which might well has been done to add Mac support.<br /><br />Microsoft has much to worry. Google worked very closely with CodeWeaver on Picasa port, offering them a <a href="http://code.google.com/wine.html">large</a> amount of software help, it would be a trivial matter for Google to just buy CodeWeaver and make it free [making my wish come true]. CodeWeaver lets you run a lot of Microsoft Windows application on Linux.<p>In other news, Rediff ran a <a href="http://in.rediff.com/money/2006/may/26spec1.htm">review</a> of OpenOffice today. They are pretty happy with it. Bad day to be in Redmond I guess.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
