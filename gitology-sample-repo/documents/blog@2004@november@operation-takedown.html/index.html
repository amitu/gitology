<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Canada is going for a new <a href="http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20041104.gtcopyrightnov4/BNStory/Technology/">Copyright Treaty</a>: <span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote> In what is bound to be a controversial element, the committee recommended that Internet service providers (ISPs) must be held liable for copyrighted material that goes through their systems. To be exempt from that liability, the ISPs must show they are acting as true "intermediaries," without actual or constructive knowledge of the content. </blockquote></span> <br /><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a> has published an excellent <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/06/save_canadas_interne.html">article</a> arguing why it is a bad idea:<span style="font-style: italic;"> <br /><blockquote>Now what is and isn't a copyright infringement isn't anything like a clearcut issue. ISPs aren't equipped to evaluate what's infringing and what isn't -- hell, even Supreme Court judges have a hard time figuring it out. Operating a server doesn't qualify you to understand and evaluate copyright law.
<br /> <br />So there's a get-out-of-jail in notice-and-takedown. If you respond to accusations of infringement by taking your customers' materials offline quickly, you won't share in their liability. Now, given the kinds of penalties available to rights-holders for online infringment (in the US, it's $150,000 per infringement!), it's not surprising that most ISPs avail themself of this "safe harbour," removing stuff whenever a complaint comes in. </blockquote></span> <br />Also read this <a href="http://www.anti-dmca.org/faq_local.html">FAQ</a> to understand other issues involved in these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=dmca&amp;fulltext=Search">laws</a>.
