<br /><blockquote>The universe is out of control, in a runaway acceleration. Eventually all intelligent life will face the final doom&#226;the big freeze. An advanced civilisation must embark on the ultimate journey: fleeing to a parallel universe.
<br /></blockquote> <br />But isn't all that supposed to happen like billions of years from now? Or so we thought before something happened in 1998 in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Australian National University:
<br /><blockquote>... they could not believe their own data. Some unknown force was pushing the galaxies apart, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. Brian Schmidt, one of the group leaders, said, "I was still shaking my head, but we had checked everything&#226;&#346; I was very reluctant to tell people, because I truly thought that we were going to get massacred."
<br /> <br />Physicists went scrambling back to their blackboards and realised that some "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy">dark energy</a>" of unknown origin, akin to Einstein's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant">cosmological constant</a>," was acting as an anti-gravity force. Apparently, empty space itself contains enough repulsive dark energy to blow the universe apart. The more the universe expands, the more dark energy there is to make it expand even faster, leading to an exponential runaway mode.</blockquote> <br />Relax, it would still happen in a distant future, but that doesn't mean we should not start making plans to <a href="http://prospectmagazine.co.uk/article_details.php.6701.html">escape from the universe</a>.
