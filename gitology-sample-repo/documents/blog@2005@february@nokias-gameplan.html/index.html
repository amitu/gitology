<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Read about the Nokia-Microsoft <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050214/ukm025_2.html">canoodle</a> on v-day, and went running to check what <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russ</a> has to say <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008311.html">about it</a>. Some context information to appreciate the real significance of this story is <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008231.html">here</a>, as I talked about <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2005/01/russ-on-microsofts-endgame.html">earlier</a>. Microsoft is putting pieces of its plan together, but I think something else might be going on here too. They recently announced support for <a href="http://press.nokia.com/PR/200501/978226_5.html">Python</a> on their devices, and then brought <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008305.html">Macromedia Flash</a> into the picture. They also silently developed a <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2004/10/nokia-browser.html">Nokia Browser</a> and licensed <a href="http://www.dmeurope.com/default.asp?ArticleID=6043">ActiveSync</a> from Microsoft, for emails and stuff. Russ says Nokia-MS deal is a precursor to a Nokia branded Windows Mobile phone but if  you put it all together, it seems on contrary. Nokia seems to have no plans to switch to Windows Mobile, [though they would probably roll out a few models with Windows Mobile to meet the demands of higher end users], rather they focusing on their own platform(<a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/1,6566,1_32,00.html">Symbian</a>) and are putting great efforts in enhancing it. If this is so we may also expect some licensing deals of Nokia with Apple for their iTunes service [this would blow a hole in Motorola's hopes of playing an important role in possible Microsoft-Nokia vs Apple-Motorola checkmate scenario if Nokia ignored Apple].<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
