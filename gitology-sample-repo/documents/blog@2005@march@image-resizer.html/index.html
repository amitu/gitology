<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>UPDATED: Added comparative <a href="http://photos8.flickr.com/7279467_907d3f3d23_o.png">screenshot</a>. <br /><br />Just finished a small program for resizing images, more as an exercise to learn various tools than anything else, though I think I will be using it. It was developed in python, using <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/index.php">PyQt</a>. First, used <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/designer.html">Qt Designer</a>, and created the ui files (<a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/resizer/imageresizer.ui">imageresizer.ui</a> and <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/resizer/imagepreviewer.ui">imagepreviewer.ui</a>) and the implementations  (<a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/resizer/imageresizer.ui.h">imageresizer.ui.h</a> and <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/resizer/imagepreviewer.ui.h">imagepreviewer.ui.h</a>). These were translated to python source code using <span style="font-weight: bold;">pyuic.exe</span> that comes with PyQt. To test them I used <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/resizer/Image%20Resizer.py">Image Resizer.py</a>. After playing with all these for couple of hours, when things started to look satisfactory, I started thinking about distribution. I have individually installed Python, Qt and PyQt, which not everyone has, <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/#using-py2exe">py2exe</a> to rescue! I had to create a small <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/resizer/setup.py">setup.py</a>, and run <span style="font-weight: bold;">"python setup.py py2exe <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/py2exe-users/2264332">--includes sip</a>"</span>, to generate self contained executable resolving all the dependencies. Then I had to create some icon file, and found <a href="http://www.x2studios.com/index.php?page=products&amp;id=11">LiquidIcon</a> quite handy. I wanted to add an item to right click context menu for image files in windows explorer, that will launch the resizer, not having any experiece with that, I found <a href="http://www.jfitz.com/tips/rclick_custom.html">this</a> very informative. The final step was to put everything together and creat an installer. I had two free options, <a href="http://www.winamp.com/about/">NullSoft</a>'s <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS</a> (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System), they have quite a few interesting <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/pinkumbrella.phtml">projects</a>; and <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>. Both of them are quite cool, come with decent editors to speedup the work, have very little overhead on executable size, good compression etc. I went ahead with Inno Setup, as as soon as I had finished installing it, the editor popped up, opened a wizard, and I finished creating my first installer in less than the 5 mins Firefox told me the other fellow is going to take for download. I tweaked it a bit for next half an hour or so to get the registry setting working. <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/resizer/installer.iss">installer.iss</a> (Open it in <a href="http://www.istool.org/default.aspx/">ISTool</a>). Finally, putting together 7MB for Qt, 1MB for Python, and 20KB for my scripts, I got a 2.64MB <a href="http://us.f1f.yahoofs.com/bc/3c5bce20/bc/Fundoo/ImageResizerInstaller.exe?bfqgdPCBNlpN0aL6">installer</a>. <br /> <br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
