When prey arrives they quickly seize its extremities, pulling on legs, arms and antennae until the hostage is rendered immobile. Once trapped, other ants from the colony arrive to sting and bite the prey until it is paralyzed (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050418/multimedia/050418-11-m1.html">see video</a>).</span></blockquote><br />Check out the video! Also these amazonian ants also know how to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/science/national/2005/02/09/ants-glide050109.html">glide in air to reach home</a>, and  how to <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Ehedlund/dev/ants/GenusPages/Formicinae/Genus225-long.html">make slaves</a>!<br /><br />So <a href="http://chaturvedi.blogspot.com/">Namit</a>, is it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design">Intelligent Design</a> or nature selecting the fittest out of the randomly mutating ones? Is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_complexity">irreducible complexity</a> already? Did alians create them, and the amazon vally to justify those "features"? ;-)<br /><br />PS: <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2177">The other side of the evolution</a>.
