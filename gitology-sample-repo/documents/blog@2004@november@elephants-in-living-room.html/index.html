<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.Kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a> has an <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/11/21/104921/15">op-ed</a> about a possible severe economic correction that can happen in US economy. Then there is a <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2004/11/21/104921/15/42#42">comment</a> that says:
<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>So what kind of things can be done to fix any of these problems.  The only one that has an obvious solution is deficit reduction, but that one is not easy, either.  Reduce spending (not easy, and probably almost impossible with one party in charge of everything), raise taxes (this has become tantamount to murder by those in charge), hope (pray!) for big economic growth (which raises revenue from taxes).
<br /> <br />What else?</blockquote></span> <br />Can't think of anything myself either. So there is a problem with apparently no standard solution, but they have a government capable of executing a non standard solution if they had to. Atleast I am hoping it would be interesting like most elephant stories. :-)
