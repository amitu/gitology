All proved harmless.</p></blockquote> <p>It amazes me that 10,000 false alarms -- instances where the security system failed -- are being touted as proof that the system is working.</p> <blockquote>As an example of how the system was working, Bonner said on Jan. 26, 2005, a machines got a hit from a South Korean vessel at the Los Angeles seaport. The radiation turned out to be emanating from the ship's fire extinguishing system and was no threat to safety.</blockquote> <p>That sounds like an example of how the system is not working to me. Sometimes I wish that those in charge of security actually understood security.</p> </blockquote><br />Also check out Bruce's latest <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0503.html">newsletter</a> (<a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-back.html">backissues</a>). <br /> <br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
