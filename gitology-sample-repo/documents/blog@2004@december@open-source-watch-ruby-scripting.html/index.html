If you are looking for a good programming tool for quickly developing a professional one off application, Ruby's <a href="http://developer.kde.org/language-bindings/ruby/">KDE bindings</a> maybe just the thing for you. There is a quick <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Tutorial/">tutorial</a> and an <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/intro.html">online book</a> to get you started. You may also want to read a quite informative <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonVsRuby">comparison</a> of Python with Ruby. If you are web developer or write enterprise applications with JAVA etc, take a look at <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/show/HomePage">Ruby on Rails</a>(<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">api</a>), they have a nice <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/cat_ruby.html">blog</a> too.
<br /> <br />KDevelop provides a GUI bulder and Debugger for rapid application development(RAD) with Ruby, which is getting <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/doc/technotes/rubyrad.html">better</a>. There is a nice <a href="http://developer.kde.org/language-bindings/ruby/kde3tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a> on using KDE libraries with Ruby. And if you have lots of code in C/C++, extending Ruby to use them is <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/11/18/extending_ruby.html">easy</a>.
<br /> <br />PS: Esp. read the chapter on Ruby's <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/tut_classes.html">classes</a> if you think you know all about object oriented programming and are looking for something new.
