<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>I was looking for phone number of the <a href="http://www.cb-india.com/">computer book shop</a> in Mumbai, but their site is apparently down for maintainence. Remebered about the service offered by the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> called <a href="http://web.archive.org/collections/web.html">wayback machine</a>, and checked the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.cb-india.com/">old versions</a> and got the number! Also check out the oldest stored version of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19971221012817/http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
