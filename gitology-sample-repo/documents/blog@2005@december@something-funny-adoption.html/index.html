<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote>When I hear about people like Angelina Jolie adopting African orphans, it makes me feel like I&#8217;m not doing enough. But I have to be honest &#8211; adopting a baby seems like a lot of work, especially when you layer on the &#8220;flying to another country&#8221; part. I want to be nice, but not THAT nice. I was looking for an easier way to show the world that I&#8217;m a good person, and thanks to President Bush, I think I&#8217;ve found it.<br /><br />The President wants people to adopt the embryos that can&#8217;t be used for stem cell research. An embryo would be the perfect adopted child. I&#8217;d just keep it in the fridge, claim a tax deduction for my new dependent, and fend off the advances of Brad Pitt who would probably be aroused by my caring attitude.</blockquote></p><p>Scott Adams always <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/12/adopting_.html">cracks me up</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
