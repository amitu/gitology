<p><div style="clear:both;"></div></p><p>Came across this nice tool: <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Ejlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/PasswordComposer/">Pwd Composer</a>:<br /></p> <blockquote> <h2>The problem</h2> <p>Once every while, you encounter a website, which has interesting stuff available to you as a registered user only. No big deal, you just create an account and there you go. However, over time, the many, many user accounts with their passwords become hard to remember. A common solution is to have just one password for all of those sites, which are considered of low to medium risk if broken into. The problem with this is, that a rogue site owner might go out and impersonate as you, once they find out about other sites you may hang out with the same account. A little "social engineering", and you can be in big trouble. </p> <h2>The solution</h2> <p>Now there is nothing wrong with a single, strong password, as long as it is not used literally. Enter the concept of a Master Password that generates a strong password, unique for every web site where it is used. Password Composer does just that!</p> <p> Based on <a href="http://angel.net/%7Enic/passwdlet.html">Generate Password</a> by Nick Wolff, this bookmarklet generates an unique password per site. The password is based on a md5 hash of your single master password and the site's host name. So one thing to keep in mind: slashdot.org will get a different password than www.slashdot.org, just be consistent! </p> <p>The advantage of this version - apart from the nifty panel rather than a bland Javascript popup - is that your master password is not exposed in clear text. Picture this: you are in a seedy Internet Cafe somewhere downtown, and that suspicious guy is looking over your shoulder while you happen to need to login your account... </p> </blockquote> <p></p>The passwords are unique across sites, and depend on the master password you supply. Automatically fills out the forms, and only thing you will need is this bookmarklet in case you are accessing it from some other machine. <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
