<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>In 1991, according to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471599026/ref=olp_product_details/102-4394488-6595324?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance" target="_top" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">The Patent Wars</a> by Fred Warshofsky, Bill Gates said this about software patents:
<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented and had taken out patents, <span style="font-weight:bold;">the industry would be at a complete standstill today</span>. The solution . . . is patent exchanges . . . and patenting as much as we can. . . . A future start-up with no patents of its own will be forced to pay whatever price the giants choose to impose. That price might be high: Established companies have an interest in excluding future competitors.</blockquote></span> <br />Thirteen years later, according to Brad Stone of Newsweek, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6478691/site/newsweek/" target="_top" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Microsoft alum Nathan Myhrvold is putting this insight into action</a>. [via <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002291.shtml">LessigBlog</a>]
<br /> <br />So if software patents are that bad that according to someone who has made real good money out of this business, they would have caused the now thriving industry to come to a standstill, is the world trying to end them? No, on the contrary US has them already, and EU is going for them.
<br /> <br />Below is my opinion on India and Intellectual Property Rights. 
<br /><span class="fullpost"> <br /><a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired</a> has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,65704,00.html">story</a> about a proposed US law that pretends to protect copyrights, but:<span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>under the proposed law, skipping any commercials or promotional announcements would be prohibited "that would otherwise be performed or displayed before, during or after the performance of the motion picture"</blockquote></span> <br />Would I be able to legally change channels when commercials start? well according to this law, No. My idea is not to find ironic humor, but to highlight the extent the boundary between legal and illegal is being laid down, (or atleast is being attepted to), by commercial interests. 
<br /> <br />So why do I, an indian, keep harping about laws in US that may or may not be enforced even there? Well, CTBT never got signed by US, but required <a href="http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/ctbt_ghose.htm">mammoth amount of resilience</a> by Indian leadership to thwart US attempts to enforce it on India. Would India be able to do it for all the laws US forces down our throat? [Such laws are always proposed thanks to heavy backing of corporate interests, only the very naive not knows the extent US govt. is and should be willing to use their diplomatic and militry influence to support its commercial interests]. The problem with these laws are they are very complicated (plus the fact that they require expertise in IP, IT and Law, to really understand the expressed and real motives behind them), and the relatively new and not very understood notion of (attempts of) making laws in order to do what should have been illegal. The importance of the role outsourcing is playing in improving the Indian economy, and the subsequent attempts by the Indian govt. to woo American companies by assuring them of intellectual property security scene in India, so that they can push even more work here; may also play a role towards making them (Indian lawmakers) have a blind eye towards such concerns. these are not unprecedented either, <a href="http://www.ffii.org">FFII</a> <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">says</a>: <span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>For the last few years the European Patent Office (EPO) has, <span style="font-weight:bold;">contrary to the letter</span> and spirit of the existing law, granted more than 30000 patents on rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of general-purpose computing equipment, called "programs for computers" in the law of 1973 and "computer-implemented inventions" in EPO Newspeak since 2000. Europe's patent movement is pressing to legitimate this practise by writing a new law.</blockquote></span> <br />Are such moves, supported by US corporates against EU's interests? They are having long debates about it. But if EU and US do find software patents and other restrictive IPR laws favourable to their interests, and they combined, try to enforce it on India, would India be able to oppose them? Would be very difficult for Indian lawmakers unless there is popular awareness towards the drawback against such intellectual protection regimes, of the kind was present in the case of India's nuclear stance. 
<br /> <br />No I am not encouraging stealing, stealing is a crime, but not without a law that makes it so, and law is not God given, but is written by individual countries based on their interests. I am saying making stringent laws against "IP stealing" right now may not be in favor of India. Right now bole to? 10-15 years.
