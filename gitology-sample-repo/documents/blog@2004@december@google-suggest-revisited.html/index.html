<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Found on <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/18/0139249&amp;from=rss">/.</a> that someone has <a href="http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/2004/12/google-suggest-dissected.html">dissected/cleaned up</a> the javascript used by <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en">Google Suggest</a>. What strikes me though is:
<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">2) The XMLHTTP / XMLHttpRequest object to communicate back with a server and get new info / instructions without refreshing the page ... <span style="font-weight: bold;">the new black of web development...</span> go read everything you can about this...</blockquote> <br />Not really new, <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/">Internet and Web Developers</a> page has listed <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">xmlhttp-request</a> for quite sometime among their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/">articles</a>, and remember seeing this <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/XMLHttpRequestExample/example.html">demo</a> quite longtime back; but I surely welcome it getting more coverage now. Also, Joel Spolsky thinks on the <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2004/12/google-suggest-old-news.html">similer line as me</a> and considers these technologies may <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/12/15.html">raise the bar</a> in terms of coolness of the web if more companies stopped shying away from them. Just to highlight how easy and mature these stuff is, someone has already made a <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=182186">Firefox plugin</a> for the same. Open source is fast, it lets people stand on the shoulders of each other :P. Just wish <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mozilla/2002/12/17/app_dev.html">this technology</a> gets adopted more, and the the web as we know it will completely transform, as I said <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2004/12/mozilla-thunderbird-released.html">before</a>.
