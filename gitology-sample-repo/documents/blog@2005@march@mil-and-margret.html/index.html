<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across this <a href="http://www.mil-millington.com/">site</a> via <a href="http://www.retrolabs.com/retroblogs">Rahul</a>'s <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/rahulg">Furl list</a>, BTW if you are not already using <a href="http://blog.contentious.com/archives/2004/06/22/10-cool-things-to-do-with-furl">Furl</a>, <a href="http://www.furl.net/getStarted.jsp">check it out</a>. Its a huge list of things a guy has "agrued about" with his Girlfriend. Its actually quite huge, so I am listing a few I liked:<br /><blockquote>Margret is sitting at this computer (which is in the attic room, incidentally) typing something. I'm flopped in a chair close by with a paper and pad, scribbling away at a bit of work.<br />         I pause and say to her, 'Tortoise and turtle is the same word in German,              isn't it?'<br />She stops typing, reaches over, pulls off one of my Birkenstock shoes, throws it down through trapdoor (I hear it thud below, then flip-flop down the stairs) and returns to her typing. All in a single, silent movement.<br />         Your guess is as good as mine, frankly.</blockquote><br />and this one:<br /><blockquote>If I'm sitting on the sofa reading a book and Margret enters the room she will say this: 'What are you doing?' If I'm peeling potatoes in the kitchen when she happens upon me, or pushing batteries into one of the children's extensive range of screeching toys, or writing on the side of a video cassette I've just pulled out of the recorder, the same thing: 'What are you doing?' I mean, a fellow likes to feel he's a bit enigmatic now and then, a tad mysterious and deep, but how can a person see me, for example, screwing a new bulb into a light fitting and <i>not be able to see immediately and with huge,              reverberating, chill clarity precisely what it is that I'm doing</i>? It's like living with Mork. It's not even as if I can use these moments to exercise my impressively sardonic (yet, at the same time, profoundly attractive and alluring in a deeply sexual way) wit either. Because, as previously mentioned, Margret regards large sections of what we on Earth call humour as nothing but shameless mendacity.<br />         Margret <i>[spotting Mil picking with his fingernail at the goo left              on a CD case by the price label]</i>: 'What are you doing?'<br />Mil: 'I'm talking to Mark using Morse code - he's at home right now holding one of his CD cases, picking up the vibrations I'm making.'<br />         Margret: 'No you're not, you liar. You're lying. Why do you always              lie? You liar.'<br />Mil: 'It works by resonance. You just have to practise for a bit to be able feel the plastic quivering - go over and get that Black Grape case, press it on to your nose, and we'll see if you can pick up anything.'<br />(There's the briefest flicker of indecision in her eyes; offering me, for one tantalising moment, the possibility that I'm going to spend the next ten minutes - 'What about <i>this</i>, then? Press it on your face harder.' - having quite simply the best of times... but then she grunts.)<br />         Margret: 'Liar. You're just a liar.'<br />Mostly, however, we've got it smooth and efficient now. We don't have to think. She says, 'What are you doing?', I peer at her with irritation and expel air, we go on about our business. This morning, though, she came upstairs to the attic here while I was sitting in front of the computer doing some work on the net.<br />         'What are you doing?' she asks.<br />Trying to concentrate on something, distracted and harassed, I reply with some degree of acerbic aggravation.<br />         'What does it <i>look</i> like I'm doing?'<br />         There's a beat, during which we hold each others eyes, unblinking.<br />         It's immediately after this beat has passed that I realise I'm wearing              no trousers.<br />There is, it's opulently redundant of me to add, a perfectly reasonable and innocuous explanation for why I'm browsing the web alone in my attic with no trousers on, but you're all busy people and I know you have neither the inclination nor the time to waste hearing it. As an image, however, it did rather undercut my sarcasm. Margret - in a brutally savage reversal of tactics - didn't speak. She merely raised her eyebrows and there, revealed, was a face that read, 'I have been waiting thirteen years for <i>this </i>moment.' </blockquote><br />or this:<br /><blockquote>I was watching <i>Mission Impossible</i> and it was making me uneasy. Tom Cruise was doing something - infiltrating, probably, you know what he's like - and he was continuously describing the situation to his distant support buddies via his headset radio. For a while, I naturally assumed that it was simply Tom Cruise's big nose that was unsettling me and tried, using soothing visualisations and breathing exercises, to move myself, mentally, to a place where it wasn't an issue. But then - the realisation freezing my arm and abruptly halting a crisp's journey from bag to mouth - I had a small epiphany: 'Lawks,' I thought, 'This is my girlfriend.'<br /> <i>"Margret, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to wander around constantly articulating precisely what it is that you're doing at that moment, as though relaying it to an unseen control team somewhere. Possibly, on an alien mother ship, secretly orbiting the Earth. For example."<br /> </i>She does this all the time. 'Get some eggs from the fridge... here's the butter... and now a frying pan... What's in the cupboard? OK, we've got oregano... some basil... I'll go for the mixed herbs... Now I need some scissors...' <i>Who is she talking to?</i> It's certainly not me: for one thing, I can see what she's doing - and, further, am not interested - and for another, I sometimes hear her doing this while she's alone in a room in another part of the house. And - though, admittedly, there's often a huge temptation to think she functions like this - I don't believe it's because she simply has no idea what she's going to do until it's actually occurring and I'm merely listening to her keeping her mind informed about what it is that her body appears to be doing right now. Sometimes we'll be sitting down watching TV and she'll get up and say, 'I'm going to the toilet.' Why would anyone say that? Does she think I'm keeping a log for research purposes? Is she intimating that she needs help? Does she have reason to expect that she may be abducted halfway up the stairs and thus wants me to at least be able to tell the police, 'Well, the last time I saw her I know she was on her way to the toilet.' <i>What</i>?<br />Surely, it can only be that she's an undercover member of the M.I. team. Every time a van is parked near our house now, I imagine Ving Rhames is in it; 'OK, the toilet's at the top of the stairs - it's unguarded, but has a slightly bent hinge...'<br />Oh, and the first person to say, 'Well, if she's doing an impossible mission, then that'd be 'living with you<i>'</i>, Mil, wouldn't                it?' gets a very slow handclap, OK?</blockquote><br />and:<br /><blockquote>Margret: 'Mmm... Is anything in the world better than the feel of fresh bed sheets?'<br />Mil: 'Yes.'  </blockquote><br />I love these guys! Okay I will quote just one more:<br /><blockquote>Do you remember the thing about 'Shut up'? It's not on this page anymore but, if you're an old-timer (or, I suppose, on the Mailing List and have read through the stuff that's no longer here) you might recall it. Well, she's sort of at it again.<br />I was looking for something that should have been somewhere, and wasn't. I asked Margret where it was, and she said, 'It's in the bedroom.'<br />'No, it isn't,' I replied - having just come from searching in the bedroom for about ten increasingly tantrumy minutes.<br />           'Yes, it is,' she repeated.<br />           'It's not. I've looked there.'<br />An expression of amused indulgence came over her face the subtleties of which I can't quite convey, so I'll have to make do with the description of it as, 'absolutely bleeding infuriating.'<br />           'How much,' she said, 'will you give me if I find it?'<br />OK, so this operates on two levels. The first is simple sadism. Margret knows the agony it would cause me if - after my prolonged, stomping insistence that <i>it isn't there</i> - she calmly walks over and places her hand immediately on it. Tauntingly, she knows that just the <i>possibility</i> of this happening is quite probably enough for my nerve to crack. She is well aware that if, just one more time, my frustrated raging of, 'The nail scissors aren't here. <i>See?</i> They're not bloody here. Do you understand? Not... Here...                Look! Go on! <i>You</i> try to find them then! Go on! Where are they then? Eh?' receives the near-instantaneous reply, 'Here they are,' and a pair of nail scissors, then I'm simply going to have to run away to sea. Can you see the other level, the one which ties it in kind with the 'Shut up' affair, though? Have a think.<br />That's it, well spotted: monetary gain. If I've maintained that something isn't somewhere until I've had to jump up and down, hold my breath and squeal that she's not my <i>real</i> mom, then simple, human decency should compel Margret to say, 'Yes, you're right,' rather than go there and find it. Going there and finding it is what you'd expect a Colombian Death Squad to do. What separates Margret from a Colombian Death Squad - perhaps the only thing that does - is subtlety. She's awfully keen to make that bet about finding things, isn't she? Now... why could that be? Well, obviously, it's because she's rigged the deck. The reason I can't find what I'm looking for is that she's previously spotted what I'm looking for, and moved it.<br />I have innate positioning instincts, you see: like a salmon returning thousands of miles across unmarked oceans, right to the stream where it was born. In exactly the same way, when I've finished using it, I will place a screwdriver on top of a bedroom radiator and - when I need it again, perhaps eighteen months later - unerringly return to that spot to retrieve it. Frequently, to discover that Margret has, maddeningly, taken it upon herself to transfer it to somewhere else. My instincts, moreover, are <i>incredibly</i> precise. If I'm looking for a pair of trainers that my astonishingly accurate positional memory remembers putting down in the bottom left of a cupboard, then I'm not going to notice them if some fiend has moved them to the bottom <i>right</i> of the cupboard during the intervening four and a half years, am I? That'd be stupid. What's the point of having a gift for such specific location if your visual perception is so vague as to wander around all over the place? Eh? What's more, I place things logically. Where are you most likely to need carpet tacks and a hammer, for example? Precisely. So leaving them on the stairs is simple ergonomics.<br />However, for some reason, Margret is unable to respect my filing system. She spends her day roaming the house, wilfully moving things from where I've deliberately placed them. And <i>that's</i> why she's keen to make the bet. She's hidden my stuff, and now she wants me to pay for her to retrieve it. It's basically a form of extortion, isn't it? Let's call a spade a spade: Margret has kidnapped my stuff and is holding it for ransom. Really, ladies and gentlemen, it's a sad state of affairs when your girlfriend abducts your favourite underpants.</blockquote><br />and this:<br /><blockquote>A question I get asked a lot is... Um, actually, a question I get asked a lot is one I get asked by those Litigations R Us-style firms - the ones that encourage you to sue everyone you've ever met so they can have a share of the settlement. Every single time I walk through town one of their salespeople will leap out in front of me:<br />'Hello. I'm trawling for business on behalf of a parasitic company that happily feeds the special and delightful sense of greedy, self-centred victimhood that so elevates contemporary society. You can be confident of my noble legal stature because - look - I'm wearing a corporate waterproof jacket.'<br />           Hold on, let me start that again. I think I may have edged, just                slightly, into editorializing.<br />OK. Fact: I cannot walk through town without one these people heading me off. Their eyes shine the moment I stumble into their line of sight - they'll push other shoppers out of the way just to get at me. What does that say? What kind of lift to your self-confidence does <i>that</i> provide, eh?<br />           Salesgit: 'Excuse me. Have you had an accident within the last three                years?'<br />           Me: 'No. I always look like this.'<br />           I mean, it's basically someone coming up to you and saying, 'Hi                - <i>you</i> appear to be the result of some terrible catastrophe,'                isn't it?<br />           Maybe I should reassess my haircut or something.<br />Anyway, as I was saying before you set me off on that tangent, a question I get asked a lot is 'What's the most frequent argument you have?' I can't imagine why people ask me things like this. That is, I can't imagine why people ask <i>me</i> this - why don't they ask other people? If you want to ask about arguments, then ask an argument expert. I can't claim to be an expert, because I lack the vital aspect of depth - I can't provide a balanced answer, because I've simply no experience of what it's like to be in the wrong. I'd like to have that experience, obviously. In some ways I even feel vaguely cheated by my consistent rightness but, well, we have to play the hand we're dealt, right?<br />However, though I can't really say what the most frequent argument is, I can have a stab at the definitive one. This argument illustrates a fundamental theme - a core issue. Because of that, it can be used in all kinds of situations. The details are unimportant; the following example may be 'about' domestic chores, or shopping arrangements, or 'sorting out of children', or any number of things. Below those superficial, ephemeral points is the true heart of the matter. The argument goes:<br />           Margret: 'I cannot <i>believe</i> that you didn't do it.'<br />           Mil: 'You didn't ask me to do it.'<br />           Margret: 'Why should I have to <i>ask</i> you to do it?'<br />           Mil: 'So I know you want me to do it.'<br />           Margret: 'But I have to ask you to do everything.'<br />           Mil: 'But I do everything you ask me to.'<br />           Margret: 'But I have to ask you to do <i>everything</i>.'<br />           Mil: 'But I do <i>everything</i> you ask me to.'<br />           Margret: 'No - listen - the point is, I have to ask you to do <i>everything</i>.'<br />           Mil: 'Yes - and I do <i>everything</i> you ask me to.'<br />           [Some hours later....]<br />           Margret: '<i>I</i>... have to <i>ask</i>.... <i>you</i>... to do                <i>everything</i>.'<br />           Mil: 'And <i>I... </i>do <i>everything... you</i> ask me to.'<br />           Margret: 'Arrgggh! Listen! <i>I</i>...'<br />And so on. You see the problem, yes? The problem is that, for some reason, Margret is completely unable to grasp point that I do <i>everything</i>                she asks me to. You'd think that'd be a simple enough concept, wouldn't                you? Tch.</blockquote><br />and:<blockquote>Margret, had gone out. (It doesn't really matter where as, irrespective of her stated destination, she'll come back carrying another bloody plant.) As she'd left, she'd seen that I was sitting in front of the computer. If Margret is leaving the house and, as she's doing so, she sees me sitting in front of the computer, she <i>will</i>                say, 'Do the hoovering.' - there's no way she can stop herself:                it's Pavlovian.<br />Her 'Do the hoovering' had been followed by the clunk of the front door, the soft rumble of the car pulling away and then nothing but a silence in which I sat, pensive.<br />           I glanced around. OK, the carpets weren't <i>immaculate</i>, that was true. They were hardly in such a condition as to demand a hoovering, though. There's a clear point at which a carpet is ready for hoovering, in my opinion, and that point is "when it's crunchy". Even then, it's not what you'd call vital. In lots of the places I've lived, especially as a student, we never had a hoover at all. Sometimes, yes, walking across the landing required snow shoes - but no one ever died or anything. I glanced around some more.<br />           A few hours later, Margret returns.<br />After unloading around seventy-five new plants from the car, she hunts me down; finding me, by a fluke, sitting in front of the computer.<br />           'Have you hoovered?' she asks, her tone swaying unsurely between                conversational and murderous.<br />'What do you think?' I reply. (Cleverly, here, I'm indignant yet inscrutable - only my disdain for the question is clear; I provide no clue at all of the answer to it.)<br />           'Have you? Or not?'<br />           'Well, what does it look like?'<br />           'Just tell me whether you've hoovered.'<br />           'No. That's not the point.'<br />           'What? It's <i>completely</i> the point.'<br />           'No, it isn't. You thought the house needed<span style="font-size:100%;">                hoovering. If you think it looks OK now, then you're happy, right?                Whether I've hoovered or not.'<br />           'And what if I <i>don't</i> think it looks OK?' She pauses for a moment, then adds, 'Or if I smash your laptop to pieces with a tyre jack?'<br />'If I've hoovered, and you still think it doesn't look hoovered... then there's no point my hoovering, is there? Ever again.'<br />There's a degree of glaring goes on here, but I hold my nerve and continue. 'The only other possibility, as far as I can see, is that you simply can't tell whether I've hoovered or not. And, if you can't tell, then it doesn't matter - in any real sense - whether I've <i>done</i> it or not, does it?' I've one more card to play, but it's a great one. 'That is, not unless the thing that concerns you isn't whether the house has been hoovered, but only whether I've been sitting here enjoying myself all this time rather than slogging around with a vacuum cleaner. But I'm <i>sure</i> that's not it. I mean, you'd be happy for me to sit here idle for as long as I want, wouldn't you, if there's no need for me not to? It's about the hoovering, not about my sitting here idle, isn't it?'<br />           Margret just stares at me.<br />I am triumphant. A choir sings. Cherubs circle my head, scattering petals. Shafts of golden light fan out from behind me. It's an intoxicating three seconds.<br />           'Clean out the fridge,' says Margret.<br /></span></blockquote><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
