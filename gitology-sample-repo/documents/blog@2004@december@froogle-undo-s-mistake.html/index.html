<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>As I mentioned <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/~upadhyay/2004/11/im-wishing.html">before</a>, <a href="http://froogle.google.com/">Froogle</a>, Google's shopping search service, has started a wishlist feature <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/11/im-wishing.html">recently</a>, through which you can communicate your loved ones what is that you want as gift this christmas or birthday. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> has a similer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/">feature</a>, but since I last checked they don't give you a URL to share on your blog etc (you can only email it to people, a bit blunt I suppose). Anyways, I had problems with Froogle using email address in the URL that they generate to share, invariably that will land up on homepages/blogs, as that is their sole/main purpose, and ultimately to spammers. But thankfully they have rectified this mistake, and now use a wierd hexadecimal id like <a href="http://froogle.google.com/shoppinglist?a=SWL&amp;id=e5df225864d4f0442efa29d89872154a691b5f">this</a>.   
<br /> <br />BTW in case you are in a situation you have to put your email address on a webpage, consider atleast <a href="http://www.wbwip.com/wbw/emailencoder.html">encoding</a> it.
