<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across an interesting <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0412/onthenet.shtml">essay</a> via <a href="http://www.boingboing.com/">BoingBoing</a>.
<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote>The way I see it, readers and rep are what really matter to a writer. Dollars should follow from a satisfied readership, although exactly how this happens in these times of technological and economic innovation is not immediately apparent, alas. I do believe that the net has irretrievably compromised twentieth-century notions of intellectual property and that no amount of DRM shenanigans is going to turn back the copyright clock. Or as Cory puts it: "Technology that disrupts copyright does so because it simplifies and cheapens creation, reproduction and distribution. The existing copyright businesses exploit inefficiencies in the old production, reproduction and distribution system, and they&#65533;ll be weakened by the new technology. But new technology always gives us more art with a wider reach: that&#65533;s what tech is for.</blockquote></span> <br />Their solution so far is:
<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote><a href="http://creativecommons.org">The Creative Commons</a> movement offers a way for artists to make their works freely available to the world without giving up ownership. It seeks a middle path between full copyright&#65533;all rights reserved&#65533;and the public domain. The files you can download from my site&#65533;stories, MP3 files of audiobooks, and the archive of this column, for example&#65533;are offered for the free use of anyone under one of the many Creative Commons Licenses. My license imposes just three conditions: you must credit me as author, you must not use the works for commercial purposes, and you must not alter, transform, or build upon the works.
