<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>I got this in mail today:<br /><blockquote>Dear Supporters of <a href="http://nosoftwarepatents.com/">NoSoftwarePatents.com</a>:<br /><br />The political struggle over the EU software patent directive<br />is making EU history. EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, who<br />supports our opponents in an appalling way, told the press a<br />few days ago that this political process is in "chaos" without<br />precedent in the history of the EU. That's the way it should be:<br />A major injustice like software patents must not happen without<br />strong resistance from responsible politicians and citizens.<br /><br />On Friday, Reuters reported that the EU Council has its proposal<br />for the software patent directive on the agenda for Monday,<br />as an A item, which means "for debateless approval".<br />To be very precise, it's a proposal for a proposal. If it were<br />to be adopted, it still wouldn't become law. It would, however,<br />become the EU Council's proposal that gets sent to the European<br />Parliament, and that is a very important step toward a directive.<br /><br />Now, the latest news is that Denmark will side with Poland<br />(which is absolutely against the current proposal but said this<br />week that it can't fight all alone), and those two countries,<br />most probably with support from others, will stand up on Monday<br />in the EU Council (the legislative body in which the EU member<br />country governments cast their votes) and prevent a decision.<br />Those countries will ask for a renegotiation so that Europe will<br />hopefully see a much more balanced and well-thought-out directive<br />on the patentability of software concepts and functionalities.<br /><br />A renegotiation of a Council text at this paticular stage would,<br />dependent upon whom you ask among EU insiders, either be without<br />precedent or there would be no more than one precedent in the<br />history of the EU (which passes like 1,000 regulations a year).<br /><br />You can read about this latest (and exciting) development here:<br /><a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=428">  http://www.nosoftwarepatents<wbr>.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t</wbr><wbr>=428</wbr></a><br />(contains links to several articles, including one on ZDNet)<br /><br />If you have a Web site with a lot of traffic, are on mailing lists,<br />know journalists or have time to make Slashdot submissions (Slashdot<br />mentioned the Danish story in a little note but not as a separate<br />article), then please help generate some more awareness over the<br />weekend. Some online media will still be able to report on this.<br /><br />Also, here is a fake press release about the de-facto acquisition<br />of a part of the European Commission by Microsoft:<br /><a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=426">http://www.nosoftwarepatents<wbr>.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t</wbr><wbr>=426</wbr></a><br /><br />It's a joke and most people usually figure it out but it looks<br />relatively realistic as I've been told :-)<br />If you mention this in a Slashdot submission, make it clear that<br />it's a joke. Otherwise there will be total chaos.<br /><br />Now let's see what happens on Monday in Brussels. We're in for<br />a really big thing.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Florian Mueller<br />Campaign Manager, <a href="http://nosoftwarepatents.com/">NoSoftwarePatents.com</a></blockquote><br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
