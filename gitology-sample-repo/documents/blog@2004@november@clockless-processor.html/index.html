<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.arm.com">ARM</a> is <a href="http://www.arm.com/news/6936.html">going</a> to use Philips's <a href="http://www.handshakesolutions.com/">Handshake Solutions</a> to create clockless microprocessors. In normal processors there usually is a clock that synchronizes all the components, so that for example, slave component, making available data to master, does not have to worry about how long to make it available far, so that the master has read it, and it can release the bus/resource and powerdown. It does it for one (or n) clock period(s). <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/02/0419248">They say</a> the new idea is:
<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>"...to let the CPU's component blocks run at their own rate, synchronising with each other only when needed. Like a normal RISC processor, one instruction typically takes one clock cycle; but in a clockless ARM, a cycle can take less time for different classes of instructions.
<br /> <br />For example, a MOV instruction could finish before (and hence consume less power than) an ADD, even though they both execute in a single cycle. As well as energy-efficiency, running at effectively random frequencies reduces a chip's RFI emissions - handy if it's living in a cellphone or other wireless device." </blockquote></span> <br />Another disadvantage of the old method is: if the clock speed is fast enough for the maximum load condition, every component on the processor chip is running in that condition all the time, wasting a lot of power. Important for embedded system processors, like ARM!
