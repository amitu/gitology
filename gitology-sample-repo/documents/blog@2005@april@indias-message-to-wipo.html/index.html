<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>Came across <a href="http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/2005-April/000241.html">this crefully phrased message</a> from Indian delegation to <a href="http://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/">WIPO</a>:<br /><blockquote>The real "development" imperative is ensuring that the interest of Intellectual Property owners is not secured at the expense of the users of IP, of consumers at large, and of public policy in general. The proposal therefore seeks to incorporate int international IP law and practice, what developing countries have been demanding since TRIPS was forced on them in 1994.<br /><br />The primary rationale for Intellectual Property protection is, first and foremost, to promote societal development by encouraging technological innovation. The legal monopoly granted to IP owners is an exceptional departure from the general principle of competitive markets as the best guarantee for securing the interest of society. The rationale for the exception is not that extraction of monopoly profits by the innovator is, of and in itself, good for society and so needs to be promoted. Rather, that properly controlled, such a monopoly, by providing an incentive for innovation, might produce sufficient benefits for society to compensate for the immediate loss to consumers as a result of the existence of a monopoly market instead of a competitive market. Monopoly rights, then, granted to IP holders is a special incentive that needs to be carefully calibrated by each country, in the light of its own circumstances, taking into account the overall costs and benefits of such protection.</blockquote><br />[Via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/04/15/indias_amazing_state.html">BoingBoing</a>.] <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div></p>
