If we apply a 15X revenue multiple (higher than that of Google&#39;s 11), and let&#39;s assume for a moment due to its extraordinarily high monetizing potential (See: &quot; <a href="http://sramanamitra.com/2007/07/25/facebooks-monetization-strategy-part-1" target="_blank">Facebook&#39;s Monetization Strategy</a>&quot;) to its estimated revenue of $350 million, its optimistic valuation turns out to be $5.25 billion. Based on that, we get an EBITDA multiple of 105, which is much higher than Google&#39;s 29. Moreover, we may see Facebook&#39;s valuation get a cold shower, given that even Google just missed its earnings because it is finding it difficult to monetize its social networking sites. Even News Corp.&#39;s MySpace, which Google has pledged to support to the tune of $900 million over three years, is having trouble figuring out how to monetize its popularity. </p><p>No investment banker in his or her right mind would be willing to take Facebook public at a $15 billion valuation. Facebook could try the same kind of auction-based initial public offering that Google popularized. But investors have to be really stupid to pay this astronomical value for a company that is still in its adolescence with an unproven road map for sustainable revenue and profitability (at that scale).</p><p>Would anyone buy the company? Most certainly not at that valuation.</p><p>Looks to me like Facebook has been frozen--frozen by Microsoft&#39;s brilliant business acumen, and by Zuckerberg&#39;s adolescent ego. </p><p>...</p><p>Microsoft must have reasoned like this: &quot;Google must not acquire Facebook. Neither should Yahoo!. Let&#39;s play to this kid&#39;s ego, and by sprinkling $250 million on the exercise, we can establish an artificially high valuation that would bring their options of exit down to zero.&quot; </p><p>On the receiving end, 23-year-old Mark Zuckerberg must have been thinking, &quot;I must be a real stud. I&#39;ve got Microsoft eating out of my hands!&quot; If some adult at the investor table tried to mumble that this valuation may cause problems, he was appropriately silenced by the euphoria of the $15 billion.</p></blockquote><p>Smart indeed. </p>
