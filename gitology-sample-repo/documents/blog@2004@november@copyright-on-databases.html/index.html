<p><div style="clear:both;"></div><span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote>Imagine a process of reviewing prescription drugs which goes like this: representatives from the drug company come to the regulators and argue that their drug works well and should be approved. They have no evidence of this beyond a few anecdotes about people who want to take it and perhaps some very simple models of how the drug might affect the human body. The drug is approved. No trials, no empirical evidence of any kind, no follow-up. Or imagine a process of making environmental regulations in which there were no data, and no attempts to gather data, about the effects of the particular pollutants being studied. Even the harshest critics of drug regulation or environmental regulation would admit we generally do better than this. But this is often the way we make intellectual property policy.</blockquote></span> <br />Writes <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#2">James Boyle</a>, when talking about the (lack of) need of <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/4cd4941e-3cab-11d9-bb7b-00000e2511c8.html">copyright protection on databases</a> in US.
