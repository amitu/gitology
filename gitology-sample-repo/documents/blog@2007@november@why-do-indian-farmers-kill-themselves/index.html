Of course globalisation has been blamed for this, just like it&acute;s been blamed for everything else going wrong in the world. But others have pointed out that the real villain is agricultural subsidies - US taxpayers are forced to pay for the dumping of cotton in India, which destroys their market. And without a sophisticated financial system or micro credits, the Indian farmers&nbsp;can&acute;t deal with&nbsp;even a temporary loss of income.&nbsp;</p><p>But I just talked to a person with some insights into Indian agriculture who mentioned another, terrifying&nbsp;reason. The Indian government pay Indian families who have lost their father after a suicide about $3,000. It&acute;s a way of helping of course. And it&acute;s a fortune. About ten times the annual wage. Unfortunately it&acute;s also a powerful&nbsp;incentive for someone who can&acute;t provide for his family.</p></blockquote><p>Sad but plausible. &nbsp;</p>
