<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">New Jersey Institute of Technology just got another $1.1 million to continue testing their 'smart gun,' a handgrip system for firearms that prevents non-authorized users from using the weapons. By using a series of sensors along the grip, the gun can determine who is holding it and can even support multiple users.
<br /> <br />However you feel about 'smart guns,' in general, the technology is worth keeping an eye on, as touch-based biometrics look to start showing up all over the place, including the steering wheels of cars and the pommels of swords and stuff.</span></blockquote> <br />The technology seems promising, but not for guns: If you are in a situation where you actually need a gun, I think you would want it to fire, no matter what [would optical sensor for finger prints work when the hand is soaked with blood? would you get time to enter the override code so that your minor son can shoot and (probably) save his life when you are nearly dead fighting yourself? Do you need safety or do you need a Gun?]. 
<br /> <br />Others too have <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,63066,00.html">reliability concerns</a>.
