<p><div style="clear:both;"></div>The <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/6/">whitepaper</a> I talked about <a href="http://www.rootshell.be/%7Eupadhyay/2005/02/python-twisted-internet.html">yesterday</a>, also lead me to <a href="http://nz.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/%7Egreg/python/Pyrex/version/Doc/About.html">pyrex</a>, which it introduces as:
<br /><blockquote>Pyrex is a dialect of Python that is translated directly into C code. It's by far the most pleasant way to write C extensions for Python. Examining the Python code in detail revealed that the most expensive part of the calculation was the RMS - it was responsible for around 65% of the time taken. Moving just the RMS operation to Pyrex reduced that component from around 1.4ms to just 0.35ms.</blockquote> <br />The normal way of wrapping C libraries for Python is very <a href="http://docs.python.org/api/api.html">cumbersome</a>, and things like <a href="http://www.swig.org/tutorial.html">SWIG</a> also are only partially helpful, pyrex looks like the best alternative.
