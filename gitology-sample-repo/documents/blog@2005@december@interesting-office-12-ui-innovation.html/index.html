Click on the leftmost tab, and click across the tabs until you reach the end. That it. It's either there or it's not--there are no other "rocks" to look under, no other places we've hidden functionality. We've found in early tests that people find it easier to discover how to do new things in the Ribbon, and they're more apt to explore the UI looking for better ways to get things done. <p>The Ribbon supports 2D layout of controls, meaning that the kind of command presentation can look sometimes like a toolbar, sometimes like a menu, but other times more like a dialog box, Task Pane, or even a web page. The Ribbon gives us, as UI designers, a great deal more flexibility to communicate in our design things like relative relationships between different features. Key functionality can have large buttons, while supporting functions have smaller, grouped controls. As you can see in the pictures below, there are a lot of different layouts possible.</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://www.sunflowerhead.com/msimages/DifferentLayouts-9-14-2005.png"><img src="http://www.sunflowerhead.com/msimages/DifferentLayouts-9-14-2005_thumb.png" /></a> <em><br />(click to enlarge)</em></p> <p> </p><p>Something we've known from usability tests for several years now is that most people don't click on an unlabeled 16x16 icon. Sure, Bold and Italic and Center and a few others get a lot of clicks, but the curve falls off after the first 8 or so. As a result, we try to label every command in the Ribbon. We are also upgrading the overall iconography of the product (something that's not reflected in the screenshots you're seeing), but even a big, beautiful icon can't help you find a command as well as that icon + the word "Margins."</p> <p>Each Ribbon "tab" contains a set of "chunks." (You can tell marketing hasn't spiffed up our codenames yet!) A chunk is a set of related commands within a tab. Not only does this help group commands to make them easier to scan, but it allows us to not have to repeat the same words over and over in the command names. For instance, in a "Border" chunk, we can have Color, Weight, and Style commands without having to repeat "Border" in front of each of them.</p></blockquote><p>Trying to "cotentextualize" is a difficult task, guessing what user want to do based on what how they interact the UI <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-255671.html?legacy=cnet">has been tried before without much success</a>, but it adds to UI elements at the disposal of UI designers to experiment with, toolbars are in adequate, menus are typicaly difficult to navigate, a free flowing widget if done right can overcome most of their limitations.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
