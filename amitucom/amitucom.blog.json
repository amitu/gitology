            "content": "<p>One of the first thing one sets up when starting a software startup is a version control system, and when we started <a href=\"www.vakow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Vakow!<\/a>  we decided to use SVN because we gained lots of experience with SVN in previous work environment, is free, and more importantly, the cheapest dreamhost account allowed us to run SVN central repository without any problems. Other reasons to use it could be TortoiseSVN for windows user. SVN just works, and central repository and work flow is quite easy to fit in ones mind, there is a repository, you checkout, you work, you see what you have changed so far, you commit, and you update changes done by others. There are tags and branches, but they are nothing for folders for SVN. The weak portion of SVN is merge, basic merge offered by SVN is doable if you keep track of merge revisions numbers in revision logs, this, tho tedious is usually manageable. I was pretty happy with the setup, bugzilla integration worked just fine, tho I am yet to publish my SVN-Bugzilla integration script that works on Dreamhost thanks to endless procrastination. Soon I will. Promise. :-)<br \/><br \/>Another reason to use SVN for Vakow! when we started was that well, Git wasn&#39;t there then.<br \/><br \/>So what is the problem with SVN. Like I said above, SVN does not help you almost at all in merging. There is no native concept of merge in SVN. SVN is linear history of one big folder, which is organised in trunk and branches, and there is no native support for trunk and branches\/tags either in SVN(1.4). These were all cool decisions taken by SVN developers that made it so easy to grasp by developers and its simplicity means robust implementation [without letting the Gods(=Linus et al) come into picture], which all lead to wide spread adoption. But I digress. <br \/><br \/>Because of lack of merge capability, working with branches is difficult. The work flow for branches is, you have some feature that will take some time to develop, and you do not want to let your customers know prematurely know about the new feature or may be the new feature will destabilize the main code for some time before its stable, you branch off. In SVN you create a copy of your trunk in a new folder, by convention it resides under a folder called &quot;branches&quot;. You work on trunk, mostly bug fixes and minor features, on your main stable code, and you work in parallel on the new feature branch. SVN is excellent in letting you do this. But after the work is done, you ultimately have combine the changes you have done in trunk and in the feature branch and move it to trunk. This is what SVN is not good at. SVN does not know about branch, its a folder, so it cant merge, but what it can do is, take the diff of two versions for any folder, and give you a patch file, and then you can apply this patch file to some code and get a merge. <br \/><br \/>This is how it works: lets say you branched out the feature branch on revision 100, and have been developing trunk and branch till revision 200, when you realize you want to create a build to give it to testers, and you have to make sure changes from rev 100 to 200 on trunk also gets into the branch. So you create a diff from revision 100 to 200 on trunk, and apply it to branch. But merging is not trivial, you may have made changes to same files and same lines that other developers did in trunk while working on feature branch. You have to resolve it manually and its a laborious process. But what happens if testers say no go, and find 10 more bugs for you to fix. You could either revert the changes from trunk, to keep things clean, so that when you are on rev 300 lets say, you can again get the changes on trunk from rev 100 to 300 and apply the patch on branch. Or you can let the changes after merge at rev 200 stay, and keep working separately on trunk and branch. So in future when you have to merge the changes from trunk again, you have to remember your decision. So you must keep it logged in SVN commit logs or somewhere. Biggest issue is that in SVN when you merge, you lose history, you lose exactly how the file changed over time, and the person who merged would be logged as the person who made all the changes. Terrible thing in my opinion. <br \/><br \/>What happens if more than one branch is involved and merges are brought back and forth between them? The method of merging I described above becomes too difficult to keep track of, remember in real like the revision numbers are not as rounded as 100 and 200 as I used above. This leads to lots of&nbsp; uncertainty, and programmers hate uncertainty. This all leads to programmers general reluctance to use branches, to consider branches as necessary evil, and a constant effort to keep the number of branches at minimum, with a clear head of the branch defined who is responsible for merging and making sure nobody else is applying the merges and messing with the revision numbers. A small mistake, lets say you merged from revision 1946:2045 instead of 1945:2045 may lead to important bug fix getting lost in the process of merging. Headaches. <br \/><br \/>I managed with this at Vakow! almost never worked on any branch for any significant time, and given that we were just two people, of which only one can be considered a real programmer, it was not really a big issue. And after all till before Git\/Mercurial started to become fashionable about 6-8 months ago [or this is when I started to learn about them], this was the state of art of version control for me. <br \/><br \/>So how does Git help? Well the first difference between SVN and Git is that Git is distributed where as SVN is centralized. What does it mean, and how does it make merge easier? I am not sure I am absolutely correct about it, but this is what I understand so far. This will make most sense for SVN veterans only, in Git there is no central repository, every &quot;checkout&quot; is &quot;complete&quot;, it not only contains the latest code, as checked out code in SVN does, but it also gets complete revision history and all tags and branches. This might sound astounding, what if you had 1000s of checkins and tens of branches, how much space will it all take, but the Gods did step into it when Git came into existence so they solved this issue, and a typical Git clone with all its glory, compares well with SVN checkout when it comes to disk space, and even network transfer rate. These are the things I don&#39;t usually bother much as long as they are manageable, so don&#39;t tell me if one of them is some percent faster or smaller for some operation or another than other. Since the repository is with you in Git lots of things become fast, checking log is blazing fast for oldest commits, and so is creating branches and doing commits. But this is not why Git or other distributed version control systems shine. I digress again.<br \/><br \/>Because you have the whole revision history for each branch and trunk, you can do something cool when merging. In git, branch is not branch of a folder as is the case in SVN, its a branch of a commit, Git remember this, where the commit came from, which branch, and what revision. Lets take our original example: branch on 100, merge on 200. Of course Git does not use the numbers like this as its distributed and if it auto incremented both you and me can check in and get version no 101, and then when merging this number will serve no purpose, so Git relies on cryptographic hashing based on commit changes and author info to get revision ids. Anyways, lets say those ids were 100 and 200 and when we are merging the branch=feature[trunk*100] (git keeps track of origin of a branch). This is what git does to merge: it goes back to revision 100, when both trunk and branch and the same content. Then it starts applying changes in the order the happened, lets say first change happened on trunk, so it applies, then the next change on branch, it merges, and so forth. This is possible because the entire change history is available to git. In case there were no conflicts, by the end of it you all changes on trunk applied on branch and git commits by default. This will make the branch now become feature[trunk*200] because now its effectively a branch of revision 200 of trunk. You did not have to remember the revision numbers. Branch based coding heaven!. What happens if 30th commit lead to a conflict? I am not sure about it, if I was designing Git probably I will just ignore that commit and go on, and so on for each conflict causing commit, and at the end of it, I will apply all conflicting commits on top, I am just speculating, conflicts will still cause problem, but because changes are being applied in sequence in which they happened, it reduces the conflicts that happen when the SVN style on big patch is applied to a branch that is really far into the future. Incremental merging will be less error prone then such bulk merging. I just realized I was wrong, Git does something even better(I am glad I did not design it :-), it stops at the first conflict and lets you manually resolve it before proceeding.Now by the end of it, you will have all changes merged cleanly, at any time you will be only trying to resolve one conflict, where as in SVN style bulk merge you would have to resolve conflicts due to more than one conflicting changes at once. <br \/><br \/>Enough of theory. But still does not solve the problem for Vakow!, we still have others who do not understand Git, who like the simplicity of SVN or are just used to it and considered learning one revision control system enough for their lifetime, and because I have not yet time to rewrite and deploy my SVN bugzilla integration scripts, or get someone else&#39;s. And because I am not sure if it will just work with dreamhost, and because of lack of TortoiseSVN, etc, I am still not ready to switch to SVN on server. Next month may be, not yet. And this is from a sysadmin and CTO who is completely convinced that the switch will be beneficial in long run! There are other poor souls who are stuck with SVN, because either their startup\/company is still using SVN and going to for sometime, or if they favorite open source system is stuck with SVN because of either code.google.com\/sf.net only supporting SVN or because the of the excellent SVN-Trac integration that so many open source softwares are so fond of. Or for other reasons like they want to switch but could not decide between Git, Mercurial and Bazaar and few other, I would advise just move to Git, but then. For one reason or another, people are going to be stuck with SVN for sometime, and for them there is Git-SVN. <br \/><br \/>Git SVN is a cool two way bridge between Git and SVN. To be used when you love Git but your company\/upstream team is stuck with SVN. I learnt about it from this <a href=\"http:\/\/tsunanet.blogspot.com\/2007\/07\/learning-git-svn-in-5min.html\" target=\"_blank\">blog post<\/a>, I am writing my comments with using it for about a month of full time Git SVN usage. <br \/><br \/>First thing is getting SVN history into local Git:<br \/><br \/>git svn clone https:\/\/svn.foo.com\/svn\/proj --trunk=trunk --branches=branches --tags=tags<br \/><br \/>One of the peculiarities about my SVN repository was that I did not have trunk when I begun coding. I just got the startup idea and was in 80th revision by the time I realized I have not followed the usual design, and then I restructured my SVN into trunk, branched, tags usual hierarchy. This led to some problems. Initially when I tried that command, I skipped the parameters as man page told me that those were the default values anyways. Obviously enough I got some error and then remembered my SVN history. Then panicked a little bit. I tried checking out just the trunk portion but that failed too, as trunk was not there in the beginning, so on a last resort without hope I tried the full command, supplying the default values for --trunk etc. And git went on work. It skipped the first 80 or so commits, but I was happy as it got the rest 2000 of them. It kept on stopping because of network issues, my network was flaky, but was robust enough that simply restarting the process continued from where it stopped. I was already becoming a fan for its robustness. :-) <br \/><br \/>The first thing I did after this was to move into the directory and run gitk. This is a GUI log browser and was quite delighted to see all the revisions since more than a year back, with search and color code diff, way better than my old solution of using ViewSVN based website for browsing history, which was terribly slow, or TortoiseSVN&#39;s log feature which again was terribly slow, and no provision to search of highlight author etc. This alone was my justification for keeping git clone of my SVN fresh for quite some time, just to see the logs. <br \/><br \/>One of the reasons I picked Git over Mercurial was the concept of index in Git. On more than one occasions I committed more than I intended when using SVN, and Mercurial was going to be the same in this regard, but not Git. In SVN and all other decent version control systems, a file has to be manually added before SVN starts keeping track of it. The problem is many times during debugging I would change more than what is minimally needed to fix the issue and will have to be really careful on only picking the files I intend to commit. This is where TortoiseSVN shines, it made this process very robust, at least if you follow the best practices. On command line, this lead to errors. So was quite interested in Git in which after every change you have to add the file again, as Git does not track files, it tracks content, and commits only the content that was there when you added the file using &quot;git add&quot;. <br \/><br \/>Anyways, if you prefer, you can get a behavior of commit very similar to SVN, but I like the Git default. <br \/><br \/>First things first. By the end of &quot;git svn clone&quot; this is what would happen: you will get a folder named on your project derived from svn path. This folder will contain the latest trunk.<\/p><p>Note: git repositories are not cluttered with .svn like folders all over, there is only one .git folder in top level folder which contains all git related data. <br \/><br \/>Now the work begins. <br \/><br \/>Lets say you made some changes in trunk. You can view the changes by &quot;git diff&quot;. If you jump ahead and add a file that you have decided to commit by calling &quot;git add filename&quot;, &quot;git diff&quot; will stop showing the changes in that file, or more strictly changes in that file till the moment you added it. The changes have gone into &quot;index&quot;. To see the changes in the index you have to run &quot;git diff --cached&quot;. <br \/><br \/>You can always see the status of files you have modified or added to index for checkin by running &quot;git status&quot;.<br \/><br \/>Next thing we are going to do is committing. As you have seen already, just changing is not enough, you have to add the files again before you can commit anything. You commit by running &quot;git commit&quot; obviously enough, but if you are a command line warrior, you will miss\/hate the fact that git does not think &quot;git ci&quot; is the same as &quot;git commit&quot; as does SVN. But if you are on a decent shell and operating system, the excellent tab completion won&#39;t let you miss it all that much. Anyways. And yes, if you are coming from SVN, don&#39;t be surprised by the speed of git commit, its nearly instantaneous because its committing to your local branch. You fellow developers using SVN will not notice it yet. But you can go on committing while net is not available. <\/p><p>If you do not like the process of adding a file before committing, and prefer the SVN way, you can do &quot;git commit -a&quot; which will detect changes in all files that are being kept track of. <\/p><p>No point committing if nobody can see. To push your changes upstream, in real SVN repository, you have to run &quot;git svn dcommit&quot;. This will commit all your changes on the current branch that has not been committed to SVN yet. <br \/><br \/>A note about SVN precommit hooks: Some places have pre commit SVN hooks that do not let a commit go unless the log message mention the bug number or include copyright notice on the top or confirm with code formatting practice etc, in those cases the previous step may cause problem if you did not confirm to those rules while committing. The obvious answer is to be careful, but that is not always enough. If possible you should learn about git commit hooks and create them conforming to your SVN repositories commit hooks to ensure that errors do not take place. Though this will mean checking if bug exist before each git commit happens, and slowing down the whole blazing git commit experience but then this is how it is, if you want everything, you have to be really smart to avoid those pesky hooks altogether, but then if you don&#39;t use tools and you look like us, most probably you are a chimp. For the matter of this howto just understand that its trivial to undo your commits and redo them if you want with Git to fix some old commit you might have done, but spare yourself the trouble, write git hooks, and get the tools working for you [if you have upstream SVN pre commit hooks. Which BTW you should.].<br \/><br \/>The above step, &quot;git svn dcommit&quot; will also update your code with SVN changes done by others. But it will only happen if you have some changes to commit, and probably only changes that are required to merge that change will be brought in. So to robustly sync your trunk or branch with that in SVN repository, you should execute &quot;git svn rebase&quot; from the branch time to time. <br \/><br \/>Q: What is the equivalent of &quot;svn revert file&quot;? A: &quot;git checkout file&quot;. <br \/>Q: What is the equivalent of &quot;svn copy&quot;? A: None. Git will detect copy, just copy it and git add it before committing.<br \/><br \/>The wonder of Git Stash:<br \/><br \/>One of the coolest thing I find in git is the &quot;git stash&quot; command. This takes all your uncommitted changes, and puts them in a hidden location, and reverts to the previous checked in pristine state. Many operations, like &quot;git svn dcommit&quot;, &quot;git svn rebase&quot; etc require that you have all the changes checked in and no un-committed changes lying around. You may have precious changes, like local settings files, etc that you don&#39;t want to checkin but you don&#39;t want to lose them either. So you stash them before those operations. Think of stash as a named patch managed by git for you. You can apply the latest changes that you stashed by running &quot;git stash apply&quot;. Your typical work flow could be:<br \/>&bull; hack hack<br \/>&bull; git add<br \/>&bull; git commit<br \/>&bull; git stash<br \/>&bull; git svn dcommit<br \/>&bull; git stash apply<br \/>&bull; go to hack hack<\/p><p>Remember every time you run &quot;git stash&quot; a new patch will be created and stored for you, so you may want to run &quot;git stash clear&quot; from time to time to get rid of old stash copies. To list the stashes stored, run &quot;git stash list&quot;. The name of each stash is pretty arcane, something like stash@{0}, and you have to type it full to refer to a stored stash by name. If you are working with branches, you may have many stashes that you want to keep around containing changes meaningful to you, so you can give them meaningful description by using the command &quot;git stash save &#39;my description&#39;&quot; instead of &quot;git stash&quot;, and to apply one of the stashes not on top of the list, run: &quot;git stash apply stash@{2}&quot; or so after getting the proper name from &quot;git stash list&quot;. Remember the stash\/patch is applied to current branch.<br \/><br \/>Working with branches:<br \/><br \/>Now the true wonder of Git. It confused me initially quite some, so hopefully this writeup will help a git newbie.<br \/><br \/>Some basics: branches in Git are of two types, local and remote. You can not work on remote branches directly, only by branching them locally can you commit any changes. So the SVN trunk and other branches and tags for that matter are visible to Git as remote branches, and &quot;git svn clone&quot;, the first step in this howto, has created a local branch from trunk called master and checked it out for you. <br \/><br \/>To be on top of branches, get into the habit of running &quot;git branch&quot;. This shows all local branches and indicates the current one. If you have followed this writeup, you should have a local git branch called master, and &quot;git branch&quot; will output just &quot;* master&quot;. * meaning master is the currently checked out branch, and you can see its content in the current directory. &quot;git branch -a&quot; or &quot;git branch -a --color&quot; will show you all the branches, local and remote. <br \/><br \/>If you want to explore any SVN branch or tag, which is remote branch in Git&#39;s world, you can check them out:<br \/><br \/>&quot;git checkout b_web20&quot;<br \/><br \/>This command will bring the content of the current directory in the state that is there on the HEAD of b_web20 SVN branch. You can look but you can not commit. If you do a &quot;git branch&quot; now, it will show &quot;* (no branch)&quot; as you are viewing a remote branch. <br \/><br \/>To start work on any of the branches or trunk, you have to create a local branch first, and that is done using &quot;git checkout -b local_branch_name remote_branch_name&quot;, so you can say &quot;git checkout -b web20 b_web20&quot; and it will create a branch for you and select is so that the content of current folder will reflect that branch. Now if you do &quot;git branch&quot;, it will show &quot;* web20&quot;, and also &quot;master&quot; since it was created by git svn clone and is still around, a copy of trunk. <br \/><br \/>Note: There is one more idiosyncrasy that you will have to learn, sometimes someone will create a new branch in SVN, and you will want to work on it, but you won&#39;t find it when you do &quot;git branch -a&quot;, and neither &quot;git svn rebase&quot; not &quot;git svn dcommit&quot; will help. You will have to execture &quot;git svn fetch&quot; to get the new branch. Why? Beats me. [I guess rebase only rebases the current branch, and dcommit only syncs new commits on the current branch, because both are working with current branch, they don&#39;t this care about other new branches. Programmers may be smart but they are seldom nice. ]<br \/><br \/>So you have created lots of local branches reflecting the remote SVN branches. You can make changes and commit, and &quot;svn dcommit&quot; will push the commits in appropriate remote branch for you, commits in master &lt;= trunk will go to trunk and in web20 &lt;= b_web20 will go to b_web20. <br \/><br \/>Now comes the question of merging. First use case is: you are working on branch web20, which is local for remote b_web20, but changes have happened in trunk that you want to merge to web20. You have to run &quot;git merge master&quot; which you have branch web20 checked out. More strictly I am assuming b_web20 was created from trunk. It will merge the changes and commit them for you to your local branch web20. You can run &quot;git merge --no-commit master&quot; to avoid commit. <br \/><br \/>Note: &quot;git commit --amend&quot; can anytime be used to amend the change log for the previous commit. This often is useful for me to tailor the commit log when I accidentally &quot;git merge&quot; without &quot;--no-commit&quot; flag. <br \/><br \/>The second scenario is: you are satisfied with the branch and you want to merge it with trunk. You can do so by &quot;git pull . web20&quot; while you have checked out branch master, which was created from trunk. Be careful if you do a &quot;git merge web20&quot; instead, the master local branch will get associated with remote b_web20, and nothing will be merged. If it happens you can get another copy of trunk by doing &quot;git checkout -b master2 trunk&quot; and run the proper &quot;git pull&quot; in it. This too will commit the change, and you may want to amend the commit log. Also remember either of these merges will merge and commit in your local git repository only, you will have to run &quot;git svn dcommit&quot; to push these changes to SVN repository. <\/p><p>An unused branch can be deleted by running &quot;git branch -d branchname&quot;. Note this will not delete the branch unless all local commits to it has been pulled or merged into some other branch.&nbsp; <\/p><p>PS: Vakow! is hiring, so if you want to work with a really cool startup in Mumbai, get in touch! <\/p>",

If we apply a 15X revenue multiple (higher than that of Google&#39;s 11), and let&#39;s assume for a moment due to its extraordinarily high monetizing potential (See: &quot; <a href=\"http:\/\/sramanamitra.com\/2007\/07\/25\/facebooks-monetization-strategy-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook&#39;s Monetization Strategy<\/a>&quot;) to its estimated revenue of $350 million, its optimistic valuation turns out to be $5.25 billion. Based on that, we get an EBITDA multiple of 105, which is much higher than Google&#39;s 29. Moreover, we may see Facebook&#39;s valuation get a cold shower, given that even Google just missed its earnings because it is finding it difficult to monetize its social networking sites. Even News Corp.&#39;s MySpace, which Google has pledged to support to the tune of $900 million over three years, is having trouble figuring out how to monetize its popularity. <\/p><p>No investment banker in his or her right mind would be willing to take Facebook public at a $15 billion valuation. Facebook could try the same kind of auction-based initial public offering that Google popularized. But investors have to be really stupid to pay this astronomical value for a company that is still in its adolescence with an unproven road map for sustainable revenue and profitability (at that scale).<\/p><p>Would anyone buy the company? Most certainly not at that valuation.<\/p><p>Looks to me like Facebook has been frozen--frozen by Microsoft&#39;s brilliant business acumen, and by Zuckerberg&#39;s adolescent ego. <\/p><p>...<\/p><p>Microsoft must have reasoned like this: &quot;Google must not acquire Facebook. Neither should Yahoo!. Let&#39;s play to this kid&#39;s ego, and by sprinkling $250 million on the exercise, we can establish an artificially high valuation that would bring their options of exit down to zero.&quot; <\/p><p>On the receiving end, 23-year-old Mark Zuckerberg must have been thinking, &quot;I must be a real stud. I&#39;ve got Microsoft eating out of my hands!&quot; If some adult at the investor table tried to mumble that this valuation may cause problems, he was appropriately silenced by the euphoria of the $15 billion.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Smart indeed. <\/p>",

This Islamic Law is derived from Quran and authentic HADITH, and both Quran and Hadith belong from the life of Muhammad to its not a 20th century Law. I know before 20th century there was no Fatwa about this but there was a common understanding between Muslims on this issue. The art of pictures and illustration of Muhammad (PBUH) was only practiced in Iran or Shia Muslims. One thing is very important in this issue, not all Shia practice this. Even then painting of face was not allowed in Shia community. That is why you will find majority of illustrations with a white blank face or a face covered with Vail. But in 20th century some illustrations showing face were discovered and then Muslim scholars decided to put a Fatwa or Islamic Law in place to block this move. <\/p><\/blockquote><p>I wonder how is Internet legal in Muslim countries!

            "content": "<p>I usually do not believe in isms like liberalism or socialism or capitalism; or rather I should say I go by &quot;makes-sense-ism&quot;. <br \/><br \/>Since after talking about suicide in my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amitu.com\/blog\/2007\/december\/comments-free-be-foolish\/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post the other day<\/a>, I have come to change my opinion a little bit. The liberal stand on suicide seems to be &quot;its my body, and I should be free to do anything with it, including ending it, as long as its not affecting others&quot; or in other words &quot;right to live implicitly means right to not live, like right to speech implies right to stay silent&quot;. <br \/><br \/>Lets see what makes-sense-ism say about this issue. First of all, its not suicide whose legality we are really talking about, its attempted suicide, so the liberal argument is kind of null and void. If someone is dead, it really doesn&#39;t matter if he committed a crime or not. Well not really, in old England for example, one used to lose his\/her nobility if they committed suicide. Similarly they would not get normal funeral, the family may not get insurance benefits or other benefits from governments [though that would be punishing the wrong person]. But so is not the case in India, and few other countries countries with suicide laws, and suicide effectively can be considered beyond legal consequences. <br \/><br \/>Now lets consider &quot;(failed) attempt to commit suicide&quot;, liberals and conservatives differ here. Liberals seems to imply that since nobody but the person who tried to commit suicide,&nbsp; is getting hurt in the process, it should really not be a crime. Right to live argument can not be really invoked here, but victimless crime can be, sort of. Conservatives, where as, seems to imply that its societies roll to protect every life, even from the person themselves, and thus society should do everything in their capacity to deter them from hurting themselves. <br \/><br \/>Liberals are wrong. This is not a victimless crime. State resources are precious, emergency medical treatment, police investigation, that can be better utilized for someone really needy(who did not bring this to themselves) and there is kins&#39; emotional distress, and possibly financial too. This line of reasoning takes us close to conservative point of view, strong penalty seems to be warranted to deter people from committing suicide (and failing). Following this reasoning a lot of countries adopted suicide laws with penalties for attempted suicide. <br \/><br \/>But conservatives are wrong too (but not for obvious reasons) (and a most of the countries did retract this law). The first argument that comes in mind after reading the above is: deterrence does not really work in this case, as you can not deter someone by scaring them about failure of what they are doing, as they are not aiming for failure anyways. You can not scare someone about going to some room, when they are not planning to go to that room in first place. Deterrence argument should be out of window. But not really, someone might say, this still is better than nothing, they will keep this in the back of their mind, and they would still consider the chance of failure and its consequences, and will be deterred a little bit. <br \/><br \/>How do we resolve this? Or is it the valid conclusion? In the spirit of &quot;strong opinions, weakly held&quot;, my current opinion on this seems to be something like this: what really matters is if we consider the problem as a black box, without caring about what is right and wrong, and should be-s and should not not be-s, and focus on just rational conclusions and numbers to guide us. Let see what numbers would be affected, and which way we should try to move them. Sounds cold, but here is how the numbers play: since state has to provide medical treatment and police investigation anyways, penalty or no penalty is not making any difference in the amount of money spent by state. In fact jail costs, and so does judicial proceedings leading to it, so making it a crime is bad from economy point of view. <br \/><br \/>The other number, which is probably a little more significant is number of lives lost\/gained. If 500 people are dying today per unit time, and a new bill is passed, and the ultimate consequence of it is 600 people dying per unit time, everything else remaining equal, the law is bad, and if only 400 dies, then its good, this much we can say without knowing what the law states. So how will number of deaths be effected by this law? Think from the point of view of the person who just tried to kill themselves but failed. They probably cut themselves, and after hours they realize they are not going to die, and its just too painful, or may be they popped some pills and all they got is nausea and uncontrolled vomiting. Lets consider the failed attempts where the victim\/culprit is suffering and need help, and they are faced with the question of calling it quits (may be just for now) and requesting help. [I am claiming that in the other case; wherein either the person is not suffering from any pain, or is still determined to die and is not planning to quit despite the pain or they have passed out or in so much pain to not be able to think; the number of deaths will depend on factors other than this law, and thus can be ignored from this discussion]. Now the suffering fellow is thinking, if suicide is a crime, and if he calls medical attention, he\/she will be reported and charged, and jailed ultimately, and this will just add up to the misery that forced them to commit suicide in the first place. I guess the essence of my argument is: this law will not deter them from trying to commit suicide, this will deter them from calling for help when they fail. They will try all possible avenues, self treatment, reaching out to friends who may not be qualified enough, or contacting &quot;legally liberal with a fee&quot; doctors, and calling regular emergency numbers would really be the last resort that the victim\/culprit would be mulling over. If nothing else this will waste precious amount of time (they would be sitting thinking\/hoping\/telling themselves that if they just waited a little more, the pain will go down, or may be they will pass out) that might end up being too costly given the emergency nature of the situation. If there was no fear of prosecution, the victim\/culprit would just call for help as soon as they realize its even a little bit more painful than they expected. <br \/><br \/>Recapping, suicide attempt laws increase the cost to state (judicial and correction facilities), and increase the number of deaths (due to improper or delayed medical attention), without reaping any benefits, and therefore does not make sense (to me at least, if you differ, speak up!), and therefore should be abolished from India, one of the few countries that still has such laws. <\/p><p>PS: What about planning to commit suicide, should it be legal? To me this is too much of a thought crime situation,&nbsp; where would one draw the line, when someone gets a gun? or when they confess to a friend that they are having such feelings? Shrink is what they need, not courts.&nbsp; <\/p>",

Read that first.&nbsp; <\/p><p>While I am still have not thought and read enough on the issues of prostitution and drugs, I feel I can talk about why suicide, in my opinion, is punishable. First of all, suicide itself is not a crime(dead people don&#39;t get sued), its attempted suicide which is, and that should be punishable, because well, state is spending resource on you. Off hand, state has no way of finding out if the fellow suffocating to death was planning to kill himself or is a poor victim who needs protection, if they did, probably the right thing for state to do is to let them die, but state has to rush them to emergency rooms and provide treatment. It costs. Then state has to investigate if its really a suicide attempt or someone tried to kill him. It costs too. And this happens to not be a victim less crime, the family of the attempter are the victims (tho they might pretend to think otherwise due to the presence of an incredibly sensitive son of a b*tch, how might try to kill himself again).&nbsp;<\/p><p>Probably the ideal punishment for this crime should be capital, why should state spend further by housing the person in a jail, when they themselves thing they are worthless, and wanted to die, after this is ideal win win situation. But out of its immense charitable nature, state decided not to kill, and let him live. State be praised. <\/p><p>Actually I just got a thought about prostitution, and I do not know of its morality, and frankly morality has very little to do with state actions, rightly so, state usually picks practicality and smartness consideration over moral ones when acting. In prostitution, there are various &quot;acts&quot;, and they cost different amounts of money. If it were to be legal, in the heat of passion, some business disputes may arise, and feminist liberation army would be on the head of the state if state considered this as a merely business\/civil dispute. The only system of prostitution that can be practically be legal is &quot;fixed price, pre-approved and prepaid prostitution&quot;. Because this system allows for extreme brutalities(who is there to say where to draw the line?) I guess its okay for state to call it illegal and save itself from human right issues. Other option is to make rape legal too, but that too seems to have some tiny human right issues somewhere that I can&#39;t think of at the moment. :-) <\/p><p>In short, in my opinion, in the ideal world, prostitution and suicide should be illegal, thanks to the wisdom of our government for not listing to this whiny... people. And this has nothing to do with morality bullshit that Shruti is claiming. How about drugs? Not thought enough.&nbsp; <\/p><p>Lets talk about the third set of laws, that she claims are made because state thinks the citizens are stupid.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Helmet law: State has to bear the cost of treatment, traffic police, ambulance, emergency rooms, then all kinds of CAT scans are heavily subsidized at every level from government hospitals to exemption of service and sales tax on part to levies on import and so on. This and all kind of person safety laws should be removed the day it became okay for the government to let people die on streets. If you expect quick treatment, be prepared to wear the helmet. And don&#39;t tell me you can always pay for your treatment later on, as when you are fu*king lying in the pool of your blood, state has to decide to take you in or not, state has to take the risk of taking in even those who can not pay. They have to hedge the bets. It has to be either no one or everyone whom the state will have to invest in, and thus its logical that state demands everyone to wear the helmet. BTW if you are so proud of paying it up, and liberty, no one is asking you to wear the helmet, it just costs Rs 200\/- for every ride you take without helmet. State will love you, trust me.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Street food: State is subsidizing health care at every level, medicine, paying doctors, hospitals, tax exemptions etc. Anything that increase this cost, state has the right to make a law against. Sure the rich can pay for their health, but the only way state can make sure that only rich can shop on street food shops is by putting a constable on each of those shops kicking out poor bastards away. It would have been good to live in that &quot;ideal&quot; world, but we don&#39;t, and state is completely right in doing what they are doing here.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Hand-pulled rickshaw: She claims the reason is dignity, but let me tell you a few facts about economics. Rich pay the taxes. They get to use roads more than the poor. Rickshaws are cheap. They take up space. They do not help the rich. They congest the roads. Throw them out. We did. This was definetely not a moral or paternal decision :-).&nbsp;<br \/> <\/p><p>Labor laws vs individual contracts: We have huge backlog of court cases in India. Contract is bullshit unless it is upheld and enforced by a court when in dispute. Labor laws reduce the number of cases, and forms a system in which the average case is kind of ok for the poors. Moral and Paternalistic? Please! Practical? May be. <\/p><p>Dance Bars: Desperate filthy people. Girls out of money, doing things to earn it. Alcohol. Late night. Ripe for prostitution? Hell yes. See, making prostitution illegal is bullshit unless state enforces it. State does not have resources to sit 2 constables in each such bar (even then who is there to watch that they would not get bribed) and make sure that prostitution is not happening. Its not even a question of dance bars, if for example there is a street where late in the night girls come and stand, and its known that few of them get taken home for a charge, its entirely practical thing for state to send police petrol to kick any woman standing on that road late in the night. It has nothing to do with dignity. State has finite resources. Terrorists are not sleeping. We can not observe every single interaction to decide if its prostitution going on or not. You just look for patterns, and remove them all together. Smart utilization of resources it is called. Politicians sell this in the name of &quot;protecting the dignity&quot; but only the naivest of us are supposed to buy such arguments.<\/p><p>Bhopal case: <\/p><blockquote><p>The victims and citizens of Bhopal were not allowed to sue the company who took away the lives and health of their families and the prosperity of their city because the state felt that &ldquo;ambulance chasers&rdquo; would take away most of their compensation in legal fees. <\/p><\/blockquote><p>Bullshit. For your kind information the case involved was in 100s of millions of dollars. UC India, if entirely liquidated, would not yield even 10 million dollars. Its pointless to sue them. You had to sue Uniion Carbide in US. And victims and citizens simply can not do that. Where is the question of allowing or not allowing anyone? State did not deny any right, victims could have, and did sue UC India. As part of settlement with Union Carbide (US), India waived all cases against UC-India, and this is obvious double jeopardy understanding (you don&#39;t sue twice for the same crime). Did India manage the best settlement? Probably no, probably yes, people like her (lawyers) are supposed to give their opinion about how much settlement would have been right, but the thing is, it was way beyond what the victims would have got on their own (by suing UC-India). State did a favor. Talk about thankless jobs! <\/p><p>In conclusion:<\/p><blockquote><p>Do we have the right to take risks that only affect us? Do we have the freedom to live our lives as we choose after weighing the risks, even if we are being foolish according to the government? And if part of freedom is the freedom to be a fool, are we free? <\/p><\/blockquote><p>We sure do. You can do many adventure sport. You can perform any risky medical procedure. But as long as you say &quot;oh we will take risk as much as we want, but if something goes wrong, please come up and save us&quot;, as long as we put an obligation on the state to protect us from the consequences arising from those risks, the state has the right to demand some lack of foolishnes on your part. <\/p>",

Of course globalisation has been blamed for this, just like it&acute;s been blamed for everything else going wrong in the world. But others have pointed out that the real villain is agricultural subsidies - US taxpayers are forced to pay for the dumping of cotton in India, which destroys their market. And without a sophisticated financial system or micro credits, the Indian farmers&nbsp;can&acute;t deal with&nbsp;even a temporary loss of income.&nbsp;<\/p><p>But I just talked to a person with some insights into Indian agriculture who mentioned another, terrifying&nbsp;reason. The Indian government pay Indian families who have lost their father after a suicide about $3,000. It&acute;s a way of helping of course. And it&acute;s a fortune. About ten times the annual wage. Unfortunately it&acute;s also a powerful&nbsp;incentive for someone who can&acute;t provide for his family.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Sad but plausible. &nbsp;<\/p>",

            "content": "In his futile attempt to fight terrorism, Mr Mukhi <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mid-day.com\/news\/city\/2007\/august\/163165.htm\" target=\"_blank\">asks us a question<\/a>:<br \/><blockquote>&ldquo;The question we need to ask ourselves is whether a breach of privacy is more important or the security of the nation. I do not think the above question needs an answer,&rdquo; said Mukhi.<br \/><\/blockquote><br \/>Not only Mr Mukhi is completely <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/blog\/2007\/september\/mumbai-police-helping-terrorists\/\" target=\"_blank\">clueless<\/a>  about cyber security, he has no idea why the notion of privacy is so important. So what is wrong if our password are stored and is available to police. Why is someone potentially reading our mails such a big problem? <br \/><br \/>Privacy relates to access of private information about individuals. Human beings associate trust with this information. Imagine someone coming to you and accusing your wife of adultery, in one case he just proclaims, your wife sleeps with other people. This is meant as an insult and you will take it as such, and will just ignore it. But imagine if he has access to your wife&#39;s calendar, and says dude yesterday you thought your wife went to laundry in the evening, well she went some other place, and that movie thing she did with her friends last Friday, well, she dint go to the movie either :-), and few other such tidbits. Ignoring the allegation has become so much difficult now. Imagine if he has access to your wife&#39;s email account and told you that she still is in touch with her collage ex boyfriend, your wife will not be able to deny this, but she never saw him, and knew how you hated him. The marriage is in deep trouble don&#39;t you think? He might not approach you and might blackmail your wife and make some money out of it. <br \/><br \/>Everybody has stuff about them that if taken out of context can be a cause of great deal of embarrassment or in many cases much worse. Privacy is our weapon against people finding out things about us and misusing them. <br \/><br \/>Now imagine, 30-40 percent of Bombay accesses internet through cybercafes. If all passwords are being recorded, sure someday someone will discover where they are and steal them. May be the security would be tight, but may be not. <br \/><br \/>More about trust aspect of privacy. If I call a girl and ask her to come to some place, she will most likely not, but if I have access to her email password, I can find out about her trusted friends from it, and can pretend to be a friend of them calling her to tell her that the good friend of hers is in accident, and caller found her number from the cellphone in his pocket. The chances that the girl comes to the desired place become so high now, don&#39;t you think.<br \/><br \/>There was a case about a guy being lured to a place and kidnapped and I guess murdered using orkut. The guy made a mistake of trusting an unknown person, but imagine if passwords are stored for lackhs of people in some police computer and its gets stolen, how many potential blackmail and murder crimes might get facilitated. <br \/><br \/>The passwords would be stored in the cybercafe, one point of attack, anyone sitting on this computer can potentially get the passwords. Next passwords will be collected by cybercafe operator, he might steal them himself, or someone might steal them from him. The passwords would be stored in CDs and collected by someone, or electronically uploaded to some site. Sites get hacked all the time, millions of passwords will just give extra incentive to the hackers. Then there are numerous personnel involved in maintaining the remote database that stores all keypresses, any of them could make a copy for himself. <br \/><br \/>I know of kids of millionaires and billionaires on Orkut, and if I can kidnap them, I can demand hefty ransom. I might be willing to sell this idea to some underworld don to just kidnap kin of system administrators responsible for the database. <br \/><br \/>Do you really think Mr Mukhi that such risks are worth the near <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/blog\/2007\/september\/mumbai-police-helping-terrorists\/\" target=\"_blank\">zero benefit<\/a>  that we are going to get out from the privacy invasive plan that you are rolling out? What have you done to protect such privacy invasion? And if you did do anything, you would be a misreable sob if you did not, then why did you decide to redicule privacy concern instead of convincing us that suitable measures are being taken to protect our privacy?<br \/><br \/>Any data that is collected can be retained and stolen. A lot of privacy information can be gleaned from those datum and trust system inherent with privacy can be exploited to harass people or engage in criminal activities against them. Privacy is thus important. Especially against such un-thought-out measures by government officials, who usually do it under the guise of fighting terrorism. ",

            "content": "Vijay Mukhi, President of the Foundation for Information Security and Technology, is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mid-day.com\/news\/city\/2007\/august\/163165.htm\" target=\"_blank\">introducing<\/a>  a plan for Mumbai police to install a keylogger and screen grabber on all cybercafe machines in Mumbai. Why only cybercafes? Mr Mukhi explians:<br \/><blockquote>&quot;The terrorists know that if they use machines at home, they can be caught. Cybercafes therefore give them anonymity.&quot;<br \/><br \/><\/blockquote>To me this is on the verge of bullshit. Has the president of foundation of information security and technology, heard of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tor_(anonymity_network)\" target=\"_blank\">Tor<\/a>? <br \/><blockquote>Tor (The Onion Router) is a free software implementation of second-generation onion routing &mdash; a system enabling its users to communicate anonymously on the Internet.<br \/><br \/><\/blockquote>It is a US Navy funded project, I guess Mr Mukhi knows something that US Navy and EFF security experts do not that gives him the confidence that anonymity offered by Tor is not enough!<br \/><br \/>Tor is just one example, there is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=ssh+dynamic+port+forwarding\" target=\"_blank\">SSH dynamic port forwarding<\/a>  that acts as a proxy, and if you have access to a server outside India, it provides complete privacy against Indian surveillance. Getting access to a server outside India costs as low as a dollar per month. <br \/><br \/>These two solutions give access to privacy that even a complete novice can use [once you realize you have something to hide from government, and have spent a few minutes on Google for basic instructions on how to set things up]. There are more advanced techniques, I can hide encrypted information in unrelated files, like images, upload it to flickr for instance, and my friends can access it, and government can not do anything about it, unless they are sitting right next to me while I am doing all that. <br \/><br \/>It is an impossibility to even conceive that such communications can be tapped, unless the sender has made some obvious mistakes. Terrorists aren&#39;t making many otherwise police must have stopped them in action!<br \/><br \/>Lets talk about keylogging and screen grabbing for a minute. What if someone is using codes to transmit messages? This is how the world war I and II were fought, encryption. The encrypted text could be written on a piece of paper, typed and Mumbai police will keep staring at the screen wondering what the hell to do with those garbage looking text? <br \/><br \/>Further, keyboard is just one of the input mechanisms available to enter some information on a computer. First thing that comes to mind if Keyboard is not safe is mouse. There are on screen keyboard that one can use. Screen grabber might help a little bit, if mouse movement is tracked, and screen shots are taken at enough frequency as to not miss any mouse clicks, it might be of some help. But only if no code has been employed. Then many cybercafe allow USB thumb drives, these may contain mails that I want to send my fellow terrorists, how would keylogging and screen grabbing help? Many offer microphones, I can imagine few offering bluetooth. Terrorists are smart, much smarter then the police at least, and they have proved it on numerous occasions, thinking otherwise would be foolish. <br \/><br \/>This entire exercise is futile against anyone with very basic knowledge about the subject. <br \/><br \/>Mr Mukhi asks an interesting question:<br \/><blockquote>&ldquo;The question we need to ask ourselves is whether a breach of privacy is more important or the security of the nation. I do not think the above question needs an answer,&rdquo; said Mukhi. <br \/><br \/><\/blockquote>Terrorists are using cybercafes for planning terrorism related activities. I would be really surprised if they are not using their home computers for doing the same. If my assertions are correct, and the measures taken by Indian police is completely futile in stopping any of them, the question is, did the police know how futile these are, or they are really ignorant enough that all this is coming as news to them? Is this move an honest attempt by police to stop terrorists, or an attempt to save their face for not doing anything. This is not just a casual question, if Mr Mukhi knows that these measures are futile, and yet pretends it will work, I will consider him a part of terror network, who is helping the terrorists. <br \/><br \/>The blood will be on the hands of Vijay Mukhi for either being actively part of terror network by misusing his position as president of foundation of information security to use inappropriate measures to stop terrorists, or for being an incompetent officer who does not know the basics of information security and yet is egoistical\/selfish enough to continue to be as president, and not let other more competent people take over. <br \/><br \/>Here is what I would have done if I was the president. First of all, I would impress upon everybody that all such mass surveillance is a seductive but bad idea to capture determined individuals. They never work. What works against terrorist is the same that works against any crime and specially the ones involving international parties, and that is solid ground investigation. The old fashioned investigation based on clues obtained in questioning and crime scene, pursuing it with diligence, tracing all the leads, and so on. As a president I would build information infrastructure to help in such investigation, finger print database, car license information database, analysis of bank accounts. I would try to introduce the 100 year old information technology that is radio to more police officers. I would try to build systems in which various police forces in India can share investigation progress and findings. I will help build data-mining systems to mince all information conceivable from data collected all over the country by ground agents. <br \/><br \/>I would at least realize that my actions, as president of that institution, must be helping terrorists unless they are deterring them. <br \/><br \/>Indian police is helping terrorists by not getting rid of people like Mr Mukhi, who is either incompetent or terrorist&#39;s accomplice. <br \/><br \/>Am I overstating? Do you think president of such information technology security thing will know something about blogs? Could he have posted his plan on some place and invited discussion from security experts? Did he get his plan reviewed from anybody in any computer science professor specializing in Comptuer security? There are many in IIT Bombay. Or did he just say to himself: oh I am the president, whatever plan I come up with must be right, and other people would not know better, because it is my job to research validity of such plans ha ha ha. Terrorists are using internet to plan bombings, no doubt about it, did he really feel he has outsmarted all of them? This arrogance is costing us lives, and I do not feel right to mince words and call him anything less than a terrorist himself. They kill for religion and misplaced ideologies, he lets them kill for money, I guess he can be counted as worse than them. <br \/><br \/>Doctors get sued all over the place for malpractices. This is malpractice to me. <br \/><br \/>This is not just a minor mistake: there is a scarcity of police resources that we have for fighting against terrorists. Instead of trying to coordinate with ground investigators to narrow down to individuals that might give some real progress, this fellow is starting a program that will tie our scarce police resource to excessive cybercafe monitoring, and prosecuting, in the name of fighting terrorism, when its nearly theoretically impossible for the program to make smallest dent in the terrorists networks ability to utilize internet to plan next terror attacks.

Heat waves, droughts and coastal flooding may become more intense. Temperature-sensitive viruses such as malaria could become more widespread. Lakes may be depleted by evaporation. Animal life will suffer.<br \/><br \/>But as Bjorn Lomborg points out in his sharp, persuasive and aptly titled book &quot;Cool It,&quot; a warming climate has advantages, too, and not just trivial ones. Though global warming will cause more heat deaths, it will also mean many fewer cold deaths. Drought may increase in some areas, but warming also means both more rain and longer growing seasons. Temperature changes will harm some wildlife in some places. But many species will benefit from a bit more warmth. Does anyone know for certain that the net human and environmental losses from global warming will exceed overall gains?&nbsp; <\/p><\/blockquote><p>This is the crux of matter, isn&#39;t it. Global warning is bad is a naive statement. Global warming is bad for warmer(=under developed) countries, and is <strong>good<\/strong> for colder(=developed) countries. Nobody mentions this fact in global warming debates, as if assuming Bush and party are equally concerned of death of Americans and death of Middle Easterns. The whole global warming debates makes so much sense now.&nbsp;  <\/p>",

            "content": "<p> India culturally places too much emphasis on respect. An article on rediff has this to <a href=\"http:\/\/in.rediff.com\/money\/2006\/may\/24anidut.htm\" target=\"_blank\">say<\/a>: <\/p> <blockquote> <p> We grow up in a society where we learn to respect and listen to adults, in many cases even if they are wrong. We address our neighbours by calling them uncle or aunts from early childhood. <\/p> <p> When we move into business, we tend to show a lot of respect and value to the folks who are higher up in the organisation or higher up in society. So, when they endorse something, it really means a lot to us. <\/p> <p> In our story, Ravi was trying to convince Bob with a status based persuasion approach. Bob on the other hand was constantly asking if these ministers, senior officials were engaged in similar real estate deals. Bob was trying to understand if Ravi was providing these names as credible references who &#39;has been there, done that&#39; with Ravi. The fact that these guys did not participate in a deal like this but were willing to vow for success criterion regarding this effort did not go well with Bob. <\/p> <p> Again, if you are negotiating with an American who is not prone to Indian ways, it may be better to provide credible reference that may not be big names rather than using big names to receive status based concession. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p> Seeing things in this regard, respect seems to brew an authoritarian mind set, it places too much importance of status and individualism suffers. Respects eats up credibility.  <\/p> <p> <a target=\"_blank\">Peter Foster<\/a>, found this emphasis on respect <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.telegraph.co.uk\/foreign\/peterfoster\/august2007\/india-culture.htm\" target=\"_blank\">refreshing<\/a> for a westerner. Our parents like it too.  <\/p> <p> If we respect people because we are supposed to respect them, and not because of what they have done, it leads to us turning a blind eye towards evaluating people, evaluating what they have done. Shashi&#39;s blog post on <a href=\"http:\/\/bechalis.blogspot.com\/2007\/08\/pride-and-respect.html\" target=\"_blank\">pride and respect<\/a> also emphasises similar points: <\/p> <blockquote> <p> In my opinion, this - not taking pride in your work - is only one side of the coin. The other missing side of the argument is lack of respect for work. We don&#39;t believe in dignity of work - any work, however important or trivial it is!  &quot;You are an air hostess with SpiceJet or Air Deccan? You need to get out of the rat hole and join Kingfisher or Jet&quot; is our attitude. People think, as they are charged exorbitantly at five-star hotels, it is their birthright to curse every single thing and all the staff. We show respect (or pretend to) only to the people in the socio-economic strata higher than us. (And then we cry foul when we are at the receiving end of it and confirming that we are hypocrites.) <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p> We are culturally trained not to respect people&#39;s work and their actions, as it will invariably lead to situation where we are supposed to disrespect someone based on what they have done, but have to respect them because what they are. You will be blamed for not respecting someone higher up to you, you will be punished by that somebody and by others as being someone who does not respect people, and criticizes people. Respect based on status is a comfortable system for those in power, they do not want to be criticized, not be held accountable to their actions. We play it safe by just ignoring actions and focusing on the status. Teacher =&gt; respect, Elder=&gt; respect, Boss =&gt; respect, and we come to expect the same respect from others. If we do not respect people&#39;s work and actions, what we are left with is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livemint.com\/2007\/08\/13000558\/Mantra-for-a-60-year-old.html\" target=\"_blank\">very mediocre country<\/a>.  <\/p> <p> Indians are not good in taking or handing out criticism. The culture of respect says even answering back to someone is disrespectful. Looking into eyes is disrespectful. The system is so smooth with rules of respect driving every aspect of interpersonal interaction, that the moment someone tells you something against you, it becomes very personal. It no longer about the act that someone criticized and it becomes about you getting criticized. How dare he? is the first thought, and probably the only thought, not the credibility of the accusation. <\/p> <p> We always shout that politicians are only promising us stuff and not doing them, well this is what we get for being a respectful country. Status Based Respect == Lack of Respect for Action == Cancer of our country.  <\/p> ",

            "content": "After discussion with AshishS about the treaty, I am becoming more and more convinced that this treaty is a bad thing, and India must not sign it. <br \/><br \/><strong>Has No Bearing On Nuclear Tests<\/strong><br \/><br \/>PM assured as in the Parliament that this treaty does not stop India from doing further nuclear tests. What is the difference between these two scenarios:<br \/><br \/>a) The treaty does not say anything about nuclear tests, but is signed with an understanding that India will not do any further tests.<br \/>b) Treaty forbids India from doing further tests?<br \/><br \/>If b was the case, should India have signed the treaty with equal ease? Would PM be able to make the statement he made above? But b is not the case, and a is. How does it matter if the treaty explicitly forbids or if its implicit, the fact of the matter is India can not do nuclear tests as long as this treaty is in effect. Treaty forbids tests, and PM is on record saying the contrary. You may say but its not written in the 27 page document, so talking technicality, I win ha ha ha! But trust me, its the US who is going home laughing not you. <br \/><br \/><strong>Did PM Lie?<\/strong><br \/><br \/>Don&#39;t ascribe to malice anything that can be adequately explained by stupidity. To agree that he lied to us, would be to agree that he knew all this nuances in the treaty, and knowingly avoided telling it in Parliament to get the treaty through for some political or personal reason, and had reasons to believe that he can get away with it. To me that is like giving too much credit to Manmohan Singh, he is not that smart. Bush is. But he is not. US administration out smarted him, they put an excellent piece of lawyering, and poor India, we were not even <a href=\"http:\/\/in.rediff.com\/news\/2007\/aug\/04ndeal.htm\" target=\"_blank\">allowed<\/a>  to have a lawyer be involved in the drafting of the treaty. If we were not the one being screwed over, I might have appreciated the smartness of the move. <br \/><br \/>No PM did not lie. Our PM probably has no more ambition that thinking &quot;If I sit completely still, and don&#39;t move at all, not even blink my eyes, ignore what is happening around me, I might last my term! Wouldn&#39;t that be cool!&quot;. Scathing attack you say? We we, Indians, realize the follies of our leaders and we write articles about them, we criticize them, but when outsiders realize their gullibilities, they use it to their advantage, exactly what US is doing right now in my opinion.<br \/><br \/><strong>Treaty Can Be Revoked By Either Side<\/strong><br \/><br \/>Ashish objected to above argument by saying India can revoke the treaty. Now this is a pandora&#39;s box to me. What is the procedure to revoke the treaty? Having a simplistic world view in which &quot;one day we sign the treat, treaty comes into full effect, then some other day we revoke the treaty and treaty is gone&quot; is too simplistic in my opinion, black and white. What about the concept of &quot;voilating the treaty&quot;. What are the penalties for it? India will just stop getting more Uranium supplies? Thats it? In my opinion voilating a treaty between two countries is an open invitation to act of war. <br \/><br \/><strong>&quot;Why US Wants This Treaty More Than Us&quot; Or The Question Of &quot;Why Now&quot;<\/strong><br \/><br \/>You would say: oh come-on, US is not going to go to war with India, what am I smoking? I am not saying they will. Diplomacy is the art of nuances and subtleties and sophistication or elaborate arguments under the shadow of war. Lets look at the US motives. India had an offer for such an treaty since almost the beginning of the current sanctions, soon after we conducted the tests, our PM was in US, trying to revoke part of the sanctions to allow for civil nuclear energy production. It was denied, and was never under consideration till about few months ago. What, did India suddenly revived diplomatic efforts for this treaty, or could it be the timing of this treaty has something to do with US interests. They say US interest is purely financial. Sure it is financial, but it always was financial. Why now? <br \/><br \/>During the Iraq war, US asked for Indian assistance in the form of direct army involvement, then in the form of peace keeping force, then finally as police force for new Iraq government. India politely declined. We are not the only one who were approached and declined. Precisely my point. US is almost completely cornered in Iraq. Iraq is far from over, they still are increasing the troop deployment there. The Iraq episode of US-requests-troops-India-declines is not even over yet, and trouble is brewing in Iran. Same episode would be repeated there if things go out of control. And then Pakistan, Osama is still hiding there, may be with change of govt in US after 2008 elections, some front may open in Pakistan too? Would India offer troops? <br \/><br \/>May be India will. Or may be India will not. India will do what is in our best interest and is based on our values. You know why, because India is a free country. We have the sovereign right to take decisions, without getting approval of other countries. We are proud of this fact, and hold this dearly in our hearts, and will defend jealously any attempts to tarnish it in any fashion. <br \/><br \/>A shadow of the war can limit our freedom. <br \/><br \/>This brings us to violation of treaty and not revocation. It is not in US&#39;s interest to revoke it, but violation if proven can serve them. <br \/><br \/><strong>The Trap<\/strong><br \/><br \/>Look at article 1.M: <br \/><blockquote>&quot;Peaceful purposes&quot; include the use of information, nuclear material, equipment or components in such fields as research, power generation, medicine, agriculture and industry, but do not include use in research on, or development of any nuclear explosive device or any other military purpose.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/blockquote><p>Article 2.3 talks about information and material transfer. Article 3 is all about Transfer of Information. Article 14.1 states termination period of a year. 16.3 states even if the treaty is terminated by a party, provisions of this treaty will still be applicable. <br \/><br \/>To adhere to this treaty India will have to prove that any material or information transferred will not be used for military purpose. There are guidelines about how to secure materials, but none on information. And yet information has a section devoted on it. Who will you prove, beyond doubt if alleged that such violation has not happened? Information containment can only be achieved by segregating our nuclear scientists and all research facilities into those that are working on nuclear energy applications and those working on that for military purposes. <br \/><br \/>It would never be possible for India to prove any of that. And therefor never for us to say we are not in the violation of the agreement. <br \/><br \/>The treaty is a trap. Section 14.4 states a requirement for return of what has been obtained during this treaty. By the very nature, fuel gets spent when nuclear energy is produced. We would spend the fuel we will get, and yet we will have to return all that fuel once this treaty has been terminated. US would not allow us to borrow nuclear fuel from other sources to return. <br \/><br \/><strong>In Conclusion<\/strong><br \/><br \/>Even if India today scraps all its nuclear military research, and consumes what has been provided due to this treaty for peaceful purposes, on cessation of this treaty India will have to somehow return the Uranium that we would have exhausted. If we continue our nuclear defense programs, it would be impossible for India to prove that information has not been shared between military and peaceful applications. We are under complete whims of US to decide if we are violating the treaty or not. <br \/><br \/>US can take us to security council if they feel a international treaty has been violated by a country, and the conditions are not being met. This would be a huge crisis for us, and will give US ample room for arm-twisting India into conceding lesser demands like agreeing to send troops in the next war US decides to wage.<\/p><p>PS: Please post your views on this matter on <a href=\"http:\/\/somepickle.in\/article.pl?sid=07\/08\/18\/1212207&amp;mode=nested\" target=\"_blank\">somepickle.in<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>",

Every user who signs up on our system is given some kerma, default is 5 for example. The kerma of a user increases when the comment by the user gets moderated +1 or -1. A comment has a kerma rating too, the kerma can go from -1 to +5. If the kerma of the user posting the comment is high, beyond a certain threshold,&nbsp; the default kerma of a newly posted comment would be +2, otherwise if the comment is from a registered user, the initial kerma would be +1. Anonymous users can post a reply too, or a user can post a comment anonymously, in which case the initial kerma of the comment would be +0.<br \/><br \/>Then comes moderation. Randomly, users are picked and are given moderation points. How many moderation point given and how often a user is picked, depends on the users kerma, the higher it is, the more the user can moderate. When user is eligible for moderation, as decided by the system based on the said rules, user will see moderation options along with each comment they come across. A moderator has many options moderate a comment, for example user may consider it: <br \/><br \/>Normal: Gives 0 kerma to a comment and the poster, this is the default state of a new comment. This can be given if the moderator wants to undo moderations for a comment, lets say if the moderator sees a comment &quot;+5 Insightful&quot; and thinks the comment is deserving, but its not perticularly insightful, its just a normal good quality comment. <br \/><br \/>Offtopic: This is a negative moderation, the poster and the comment will get 1 points deducted from their respective kermas. This is given when commenter posts something totally unrelated to the discussion going on. <br \/><br \/>Flamebait: This is another negative moderation, 1 point will be deducted. This is used when it appears to the moderator that the intent was provoking an angry reply. For example there might be a contentious issue that has been resolved, but the commenter has knowingly ignored the resolution and alleged something completely contrary to resolution. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>Troll: This is also a negative moderation, 1 point deducted. This is quite similar to flamebait, but in this case the intent of the commenter is not to provoke an angry reply and get hasty response, but to pretend to be serious about the topic, but is intentionally being ignorant and saying wrong thing. <br \/><br \/>Redundant: Negative, -1. This is a me too type comment, someone repeating something that has already been said or discussed, and has no meaningful value. <br \/><br \/>Insightul: This gives +1 to the comment and the poster, and is used when some new insight has been shed by the comment.

            "content": "<p>These days in India, the only way to get things done is to file <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Public_Interest_Litigation\" target=\"_blank\">PIL<\/a>s. Here is how to do it:<\/p><blockquote><p>1. How can I file a PIL? <br \/><br \/>PIL is filed in the same manner, as a writ petition is filed. If a PIL is filed in a High Court, then two (2) copies of the petition have to be filed (for Supreme Court, then (4+1=5 sets) Also, an advance copy of the petition has to be served on the each respondent, i.e. opposite party, and this proof of service has to be affixed on the petition.<br \/><br \/>The Procedure: <br \/><br \/>A Court fee of Rs. 50, per respondent (i.e. for each number of party, court fees of Rs 50) has to be affixed on the petition. Proceedings, in the PIL commence and carry on in the same manner, as other cases. However, in between the proceedings if the Judge feels that he may appoint the commissioner, to inspect allegations like pollution being caused, trees being cut, sewer problems, etc. After filing of replies, by opposite party, or rejoinder by the petitioner, final hearing takes place, and the judge gives his final decision.<br \/><br \/>2. In which cases, can a PIL be filed? <br \/><br \/>PIL can be filed only in a case where &ldquo;Public Interest&rdquo; at large is affected. Merely because, only one person is effected by state inaction is not a reason for PIL.<br \/><br \/>There are some of the possible areas where PIL can be filed.<br \/><br \/>&middot; Where a factory\/ industry unit is causing air pollution, and people nearly are getting effected.<br \/>&middot; Where, in an area\/ street there are no street lights, causing inconvenience to commuters.<br \/>&middot; Where some &ldquo;Banquet Hall&rdquo; plays a loud music, in night causing noise pollution.<br \/>&middot; Where some construction company is cutting down trees, causing environmental pollution.<br \/>&middot; Where poor people, are affected, because of state government&rsquo;s arbitrary decision to impose heavy &ldquo;Tax&rdquo;. <br \/>&middot; For directing the police\/ Jail authorities to take appropriate decisions in regards to jail reforms, such as segregation of convicts, delay in trial, before the court on remand dates.<br \/>&middot; For abolishing child labor, and bonded labor.<br \/>&middot; Where rights of working women are affected by sexual harassment.<br \/>&middot; For keeping a check on corruption and crime involving holders of high political officer.<br \/>&middot; For maintaining Roads, Sewer etc in good condition.<br \/>&middot; For removal of Big Hoarding and signboards from the busy road to avoid traffic problem.<br \/><br \/>3. Who can file the PIL?<br \/><br \/>Earlier it was only a person whose interest was directly affected along with others, whereby his fundamental right is affected who used to file such litigation. Now, the trend has changed, and, any Public-spirited person can file a case (PIL) on behalf of a group of person, whose rights are affected. It is not necessary, that person filing a case should have a direct interest in this PIL.<br \/><br \/>e.g. a person in Mumbai can file a PIL for, some labor workers being exploited in Madhya Pradesh or as someone filed a PIL in supreme court for taking action against a Cracker factory in Sivakasi Tamilnadu, for employing child labor or the case where a standing practicing lawyer filed a PIL for release of 80 under trials in a jail, than the period prescribed as punishment for offence, for which they were tried. It is clear that, any person can file a PIL on behalf of group of affected people. However, it will depend on every facts of case, whether it should be allowed or not.<\/p><p>4. Against whom a PIL can be filed? <br \/><br \/>A PIL can be filed against a State\/ Central Govt., Municipal Authorities, and not any private party. However, &ldquo;Private party&rdquo; can be included in the PIL as &ldquo;Respondent&rdquo;, after making concerned state authority, a party. For example- if there is a Private factory in Delhi, which is causing pollution, then people living nearly or any other person can file a PIL against the Government of Delhi, Pollution Control Board, and against the private factory. However, a PIL cannot be filed against the Private party alone.<br \/><br \/>5. Can a Letter Explaining Facts to Chief Justice be treated as a PIL?<br \/><br \/>In early 90&rsquo;s there have been instances, where judges have treated a post card containing facts, as a PIL. Many PIL has been filed on this basis in the past. Since, many people have tried to misuse the privilege of PIL, the court has required a detailed narration of facts and complaint, and then decide whether to issue notice and call the opposite party. However, as there is no statute laying down rules and regulations for a PIL still the court can treat a letter as a PIL. However, the letter should bring the true and clear facts, and if the matter is really an urgent one, the court can treat it as a PIL. Even a writ petition filed by the aggrieved person, whether on behalf of group or together with group can be treated as a PIL.<br \/><br \/>6. What are the various reliefs available by PIL?<br \/><br \/>There are many kinds of remedies, which can be given in a PIL, to secure the public interest, at large. They are:<br \/><br \/>&middot; The court can afford an early interim measure to protect the public interest,<br \/>&middot; The court may appoint a committee, or commissioner to look into the matter and<br \/>&middot; The court may also give final orders by way of direction to comply within a stipulated time.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Painstakingly compiled by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.orkut.com\/Profile.aspx?uid=3233045518365358439\" target=\"_blank\">Subhashini<\/a>. <\/p>",

            "content": "TADA court <a href=\"http:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/articleshow\/2246619.cms\" target=\"_blank\">ordered<\/a>  6 years jail to Sanjay Dutt for possessing illegal weapons. <br \/><br \/>What he did, was a victim less crime. In US and many other countries he would not have been wrong at all. It might be debatable that possessing arms is wrong, but it would be completely wrong to say that there is no reason to possess one. It was after the riots in Mumbai that he acquired those arms, in self defense. What is immoral about it? Technically wrong, agreed, but immoral?<br \/><blockquote>&quot;I must say for every citizen, laws of the nation shall be respected. If you don&#39;t, I don&#39;t expect you to be called a moral person,&quot; Kode said.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/blockquote><p>So what he means is every person who is wrong on technical grounds is wrong on moral grounds, and technicality is the only definition of morality? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rediff.com\/news\/2007\/jul\/31verdict6.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Judge Kode<\/a>  himself later agrees that Mr Dutt&#39;s act was not immoral, why then the misleading argument? <br \/><br \/>Further:<\/p><blockquote>Kode also observed it was an &quot;eminently dangerous act&quot; as the weapon possessed by Dutt was capable of mass destruction though the accused had not used the weapons. <br \/><br \/><\/blockquote>I guess Sanjay Dutt had lighter and matches too, I guess it was &quot;eminent&quot; that he was going to set ablaze a few petrol pumps and buildings, and he had access to cars too, pedestal walkers should consider their death &quot;eminent&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t it been easy for judges if possessing means of potential crime is enough to prove the guilt for crime, but we are lucky and thankful that so is not the case.<br \/><blockquote>Kode said the character of the accused is very important while considering if they deserved relief under the POA(sic, POTA) Act. He pointed out that apart from possessing the weapons, Dutt was a close acquaintance of Anees Ibrahim and attended a party hosted by Dawood Ibrahim in Dubai. <br \/><br \/><\/blockquote>The character of the accused. It is so easy to judge, isn&#39;t it, Dutt knew those criminals, he attended their parties, and was friends with them. Being friend with criminals is now criminal? What about his friends then? And his friends friends? Is prosecutor&#39;s case completely based on bull shit? He had gun, and I am full of shit, so please your honor punish him!<br \/><br \/>It was for self defense. <br \/><br \/>If there is any situation that will become better thanks to easy gun access, it is riots. Rioters don&#39;t use guns to riot. Rioters are general population, the person sitting next to you may have stabbed a few had he got a chance of being on the favorable side of mob. One has to understand such riot, they are not precursor to civil war, and unless they are precursor to civil war, any amount of guns in the mix will only defuse the situation. Can things go the civil war way? Civil war does not depend on possession of guns, it depends on the lack or dissatisfaction with governance. A gun shot is a serious affair, guns are registered, any shot scares the hell out of people, if I have one, and 20 people step on my door with torches and swords, they will be deterred by the gun. What if they had guns themselves? The stakes will be higher. If the rules of fight were that only knives and swords are allowed, fight will last much longer, and the outnumbered has no real chance of inflicting damage on the rioters, and rioters can march virtually without any consequence to 20 houses one by one. If guns were allowed, anyone shooting in the crowd will get someone, and at-least a death of rioter is guaranteed even if rioting against a single person. Police is no where to be found in those situation, you are on your own, and gun is your only defense. Sure if those 20 people out to murder me had guns, I can be killed sooner, but I get a chance to inflict some damage myself, that my kitchen knife will not give me. Those 20 will kill me no matter what, if they are empty handed, have ropes, knives, sword, or guns. I can kill *only* when I have gun. The problem is not gun, the problem is 20 people who decide to murder someone, and while state and police should do something about it, I should not be denied my right to self defense. <br \/><br \/>If you can&#39;t understand this, may be you can&#39;t understand. <br \/><br \/>Here is the <a href=\"http:\/\/gunaccessory.com\/laws\/arms_act.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Arms Act 1959<\/a>, on <a href=\"http:\/\/gunaccessory.com\/laws\/chapter_5-6.htm#CHAPTER%20V\" target=\"_blank\">penalties page<\/a>, these are the following sections that apply to this case:<br \/><blockquote>27. Punishment for possessing arms, etc., with intent to use them for unlawful purpose<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Whoever has in his possession any arms or ammunition with intent to use the same for any unlawful purpose or to enable any other person to use the same for any unlawful purpose shall, whether such unlawful purpose has been carried into effect or not, be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.<br \/><br \/><\/blockquote>The intent to use the guns for unlawful purpose was not proved so this can not apply. Then:<br \/><blockquote>28. Punishment for use and possession of firearms of firearms or imitation firearms in certain cases<\/blockquote><blockquote>Whoever makes or attempts to make any use whatsoever of a firearm or an imitation firearm <strong>with intent to resist or prevent the lawful arrest or detention of himself or any other person<\/strong> shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.<br \/><br \/>Explanation.---In this section the expression &quot;limitation firearm&quot; has the same meaning as in section 6.<br \/><br \/><\/blockquote>Emphasis mine. This was also not the case. <br \/><br \/>Finally:<br \/><blockquote>29. Punishment for knowingly purchasing arms, etc., from unlicensed person or for delivering arms, etc., to person not entitled to possess the same Whoever---<br \/><br \/>(a) purchases any firearms or any other arms of such class or description as may be prescribed or any ammunition from any other person knowing that such other person is not licensed or authorised under section 5; or<br \/><br \/>(b) delivers any arms or ammunition into the possession of another person without previously ascertaining that such other person is entitled by virtue of this Act or any other law for the time being in force to have, and is not prohibited by this Act or such other law from having, in his possession the same;<br \/><br \/>shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine of an amount which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.<br \/><br \/><\/blockquote><p>This applies. 6 months. <br \/><br \/>Section 30 [Punishment                              for contravention of licence or rule] may or may not apply depending on the details of the case, but again, the punishment: 3 months.<br \/><br \/>I am not making this up, this is what he should be given, maximum of 6 months! He has already done more than a year in the jail. <br \/><br \/>Oh yeah, there is TADA, a law that has been repealed, that talks about terrorism, which does not apply here. Everything is wrong with this case.<\/p><p>Let me repeat what the judge said:<\/p><blockquote><p>Kode, however, said the crimes committed by Dutt and his friends Adajania and Nulwalla were not &quot;anti-social, ghastly, inhuman, immoral or pre-planned&quot; and did not cause any harm to the general public. <br \/><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Morally he does not deserve 6 years. He does not legally deserve 6 years for unlawful possession of arms, possession of arms act forces a upper limit of 6 months for very act he is accused of. He does not deserve to be punished like a terrorist, Judge says he had done nothing anit-social, terrorism would be anit-social one would say. Then why does he have to do 6 years instead of 6 months? <\/p><p>This is judiciaries desperate attempt to say, see we are still alive, we can punish with vengeance in high profile cases. His only crime is being high profile. This is not the case in which justice was done, and someone has to pay the price for this mistake. He has to go to jail because he attended some parties. And this happens when judiciary tries to make a statement about justice. Wonder what happens on day to day life there.&nbsp; <\/p><p>Sad sad day today. <\/p>",

Actually I even wrote a patch for django where you can mark a model as &ldquo;create_table=False&rdquo; but the patch never made it in.<br \/><br \/>So we went another actually much better way, after discussing it a lot in the team. We simply did not create the models in models.py, which are used for syncdb but we create a file dbviews.py where we put the views&rsquo; models. This is very nice separation of code too.<br \/>The next step is writing the view itself, which we just did in pure SQL of course. I.e. if we have the model Forum and we want some specialized ForumActivity-view then we created a view &ldquo;CREATE VIEW core_forumactivityview&rdquo; (we are on mysql). We then fired that onto our DB and the model that matched it (make sure to use the same column names as the view does!!!) simply looks like this:<br \/><br \/>class ForumActiviy(models.Model):<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;.. all the fields<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class Meta:<br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; db_table = &ldquo;core_forumactivityview&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>now you can simply do<br \/><br \/>import project.core.dbviews<br \/><br \/>and they just look like models :-).<br \/>Depending on how you wrote the view you might even be able to update the data.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Smart!

This plays a very important role in python, as all kind of singleton class patter or module level initializations that are to be guaranteed to executed only once, relies on this behavior. But this breakdowns when a module can be referenced via two different path.

Suddenly it looks as though finally the innovation stranglehold that Microsoft has held over us for many years is coming to an end. I&#39;m not saying Microsoft will go away, but cross-platform compatibility will become the rule, not the exception. It will be easy to choose whichever platform you like, without worrying about not being able to run half your applications.

            "content": "<p>If you were curios about the &quot;# {{{&quot; and &quot;# }}}&quot; in <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/blog\/2007\/july\/django-extending-user-model\/\" target=\"_blank\">my previous post about extending django user model<\/a>, they are code folding markers. Getting code folding right in vim took me some time and learning, so here I am documenting the takeaways. Code folding, hiding parts of code that you are not working on, is really cool and helpful, and once you start using it, you can not live without it. Here is how to do it in vim. <\/p><p><strong>Pick The Fold Method<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p><p>First of all, you have to decide the method for code folding. Vim offers many methods. First is manual, which is basic, you can fold any piece of text at your whim. This might be good for one off or free form texts. Then comes markers. This is my preferred approach for folding as it can be fairly arbitrary, and it can be preserved in version control and gets shared with multiple developers. Then there is folding by indentation, and language syntax. Both these will let you quickly fold things if you have not manually handpicked folding markers.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Learn The Keys<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Once the method has been decided, then comes the commands, here is a short list:<\/p><ul><li><strong>zf<\/strong> create the fold, useful for manual and marker methods. Select any piece of text, [press v or shift-v, then use arrow keys], and then press <strong>zf<\/strong>. It will place the markers around the fold for you in marker mode; in case of manual, it will store fold location in memory. Remember f by saying this command &quot;forms&quot; the fold, or just remember fold :-) <\/li><li><strong>zc<\/strong> close the fold at the cursor. <br \/><\/li><li><strong>zo<\/strong> open the fold at the cursor.<\/li><li><strong>zr<\/strong>&nbsp; increment the fold level by one, so if all classes are folded, they will opened, but function definitions will be kept folded. <br \/><\/li><li><strong>zm<\/strong> reverse of the above, if one or more function folds are open, they will be closed, but classes will be kept open. <br \/><\/li><li><strong>zR<\/strong> open all folds.<\/li><li><strong>zM<\/strong> close all folds.<\/li><li><strong>zj<\/strong> and <strong>zk<\/strong> can be used to jump from one fold to another.&nbsp; <\/li><\/ul><p>Thats it, that is all you need to know about folding in vim, all commands start with z so they are easy to remember. Z represents a piece of folded paper. From my experience you will be only using zf, zo, zc, zj and zk, and these key combinations have been selected quite wisely to make it easy to remember.&nbsp; <\/p><p><strong>Configure Things<\/strong><\/p><p>Here is my complete vimrc file, optimized for python source editing:<\/p><blockquote><p><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; enter spaces when tab is pressed:<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">expandtab<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; do not break lines when line lenght increases<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">textwidth<\/font>=0<br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; user 4 spaces to represent a tab<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">tabstop<\/font>=4<br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">softtabstop<\/font>=4<br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; number of space to use for auto indent<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; you can use &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; keys to indent current line or selection<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; in normal mode.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">shiftwidth<\/font>=4<br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; Copy indent from current line when starting a new line.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">autoindent<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; makes backspace key more powerful. <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">backspace<\/font>=indent<font color=\"#804040\"><strong>,<\/strong><\/font>eol<font color=\"#804040\"><strong>,<\/strong><\/font>start<br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; shows the match while typing<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">incsearch<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; case insensitive search<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">ignorecase<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; show line and column number<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">ruler<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; show some autocomplete options in status bar<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">wildmenu<\/font><br \/><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; automatically save and restore folds<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>au<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#2e8b57\"><strong>BufWinLeave<\/strong><\/font> * <font color=\"#804040\"><strong>mkview<\/strong><\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>au<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#2e8b57\"><strong>BufWinEnter<\/strong><\/font> * <font color=\"#804040\"><strong>silent<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#804040\"><strong>loadview<\/strong><\/font><br \/><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; this lets us put the marker in the file so that<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; it can be shared across and stored in version control.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">foldmethod<\/font>=marker<br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; this is for python, put <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; # name for the folded text # {{{<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; to begin marker and <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; # }}} <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; close to end it. <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">commentstring<\/font>=\\ #\\ %s<br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; default fold level, all open, set it 200 or something<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; to make it all closed. <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">foldlevel<\/font>=0<br \/><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; share clipboard with windows clipboard<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>set<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#a020f0\">clipboard<\/font>+=unnamed<br \/><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; set viminfo=&#39;100,f1<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#0000ff\">&quot; minibufexplorer settings:j<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>let<\/strong><\/font> g:miniBufExplMapWindowNavArrows <font color=\"#804040\"><strong>=<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#ff00ff\">1<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>let<\/strong><\/font> g:miniBufExplMapCTabSwitchWindows <font color=\"#804040\"><strong>=<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#ff00ff\">1<\/font><br \/><br \/><font color=\"#804040\"><strong>syntax<\/strong><\/font> <font color=\"#2e8b57\"><strong>on<\/strong><\/font><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Enjoy!&nbsp;<\/p>",

            "content": "<p>This is from Guido&#39;s paper <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/download\/releases\/2.2.3\/descrintro\/\" target=\"_blank\">Unifying types and classes in Python 2.2<\/a>.<\/p><blockquote><h3>Cooperative methods and &quot;super&quot;<\/h3><p>One of the coolest, but perhaps also one of the most unusual features of the new classes is the possibility to write &quot;cooperative&quot; classes. Cooperative classes are written with multiple inheritance in mind, using a pattern that I call a &quot;cooperative super call&quot;.  This is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as &quot;call-next-method&quot;, and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages like Java or Smalltalk.  C++ has neither form of super call, relying instead on an explicit mechanism similar to that used in classic Python.  (The term &quot;cooperative method&quot; comes from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/download\/releases\/2.2.3\/descrintro\/#references\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Putting Metaclasses to Work&quot;<\/a>.)  <\/p><p>As a refresher, let&#39;s first review the traditional, non-cooperative super call.  When a class C derives from a base class B, C often wants to override a method m defined in B.  A &quot;super call&quot; occurs when C&#39;s definition of m calls B&#39;s definition of m to do some of its work.  In Java, the body of m in C can write super(a, b, c) to call B&#39;s definition of m with argument list (a, b, c).  In Python, C.m writes B.m(self, a, b, c) to accomplish the same effect.  For example:  <\/p><pre>class B:<br \/>    def m(self):<br \/>        print &quot;B here&quot;<br \/><br \/>class C(B):<br \/>    def m(self):<br \/>        print &quot;C here&quot;<br \/>        B.m(self)<br \/><\/pre>  We say that C&#39;s method m &quot;extends&quot; B&#39;s method m.  The pattern here works well as long as we&#39;re using single inheritance, but it breaks down with multiple inheritance.  Let&#39;s look at four classes whose inheritance diagram forms a &quot;diamond&quot; (the same diagram was shown graphically in the previous section):  <pre>class A(object): ..<br \/>class B(A): ...<br \/>class C(A): ...<br \/>class D(B, C): ...<br \/><\/pre><p>Suppose A defines a method m, which is extended by both B and C. Now what is D to do?  It inherits two implementations of m, one from B and one from C.  Traditionally, Python simply picks the first one found, in this case the definition from B.  This is not ideal, because this completely ignores C&#39;s definition.  To see what&#39;s wrong with ignoring C&#39;s m, assume that these classes represent some kind of persistent container hierarchy, and consider a method that implements the operation &quot;save your data to disk&quot;.  Presumably, a D instance has both B&#39;s data and C&#39;s data, as well as A&#39;s data (a single copy of the latter).  Ignoring C&#39;s definition of the save method would mean that a D instance, when requested to save itself, only saves the A and B parts of its data, but not the part of its data defined by class C!  <\/p><p>C++ notices that D inherits two conflicting definitions of method m, and issues an error message.  The author of D is then supposed to override m to resolve the conflict.  But what is D&#39;s definition of m supposed to do?  It can call B&#39;s m followed by C&#39;s m, but because both definitions call the definition of m inherited from A, A&#39;s m ends up being called twice!  Depending on the details of the operation, this is at best an inefficiency (when m is idempotent), at worst an error. Classic Python has the same problem, except it doesn&#39;t even consider it an error to inherit two conflicting definitions of a method: it simply picks the first one.  <\/p><p>The traditional solution to this dilemma is to split each derived definition of m into two parts: a partial implementation _m, which only saves the data that is unique to one class, and a full implementation m, which calls its own _m and that of the base class(es).  For example:  <\/p><pre>class A(object):<br \/>    def m(self): &quot;save A&#39;s data&quot;<br \/>class B(A):<br \/>    def _m(self): &quot;save B&#39;s data&quot;<br \/>    def m(self):  self._m(); A.m(self)<br \/>class C(A):<br \/>    def _m(self): &quot;save C&#39;s data&quot;<br \/>    def m(self):  self._m(); A.m(self)<br \/>class D(B, C):<br \/>    def _m(self): &quot;save D&#39;s data&quot;<br \/>    def m(self):  self._m(); B._m(self); C._m(self); A.m(self)<br \/><\/pre><p>There are several problems with this pattern.  First of all, there is the proliferation of extra methods and calls.  But perhaps more importantly, it creates an undesirable dependency in the derived classes on details of the dependency graph of their base classes: the existence of A can no longer be considered an implementation detail of B and C, since class D needs to know about it.  If, in a future version of the program, we want to remove the dependency on A from B and C, this will affect derived classes like D as well; likewise, if we want to add another base class AA to B and C, all their derived classes must be updated as well.  <\/p><p>The &quot;call-next-method&quot; pattern solves this problem nicely, in combination with the new method resolution order.  Here&#39;s how:  <\/p><pre>class A(object):<br \/>    def m(self): &quot;save A&#39;s data&quot;<br \/>class B(A):<br \/>    def m(self): &quot;save B&#39;s data&quot;; super(B, self).m()<br \/>class C(A):<br \/>    def m(self): &quot;save C&#39;s data&quot;; super(C, self).m()<br \/>class D(B, C):<br \/>    def m(self): &quot;save D&#39;s data&quot;; super(D, self).m()<br \/><\/pre><p>Note that the first argument to super is always the class in which it occurs; the second argument is always self.  Also note that self is not repeated in the argument list for m.  <\/p><p>Now, in order to explain how super works, consider the MRO for each of these classes.  The MRO is given by the __mro__ class attribute:  <\/p><pre>A.__mro__ == (A, object)<br \/>B.__mro__ == (B, A, object)<br \/>C.__mro__ == (C, A, object)<br \/>D.__mro__ == (D, B, C, A, object)<br \/><\/pre><p>The expression super(C, self).m should only be used inside the implementation of method m in class C.  Bear in mind that while self is an instance of C, self.__class__ may not be C: it may be a class derived from C (for example, D).  The expression super(C, self).m, then, searches self.__class__.__mro__ (the MRO of the class that was used to create the instance in self) for the occurrence of C, and then starts looking for an implementation of method m <em>following<\/em> that point.  <\/p><p>For example, if self is a C instance, super(C, self).m will find A&#39;s implementation of m, as will super(B, self).m if self is a B instance.  But now consider a D instance.  In D&#39;s m, super(D, self).m() will find and call B.m(self), since B is the first base class following D in D.__mro__ that defines m.  Now in B.m, super(B, self).m() is called.  Since self is a D instance, the MRO is (D, B, C, A, object) and the class following B is C.  This is where the search for a definition of m continues.  This finds C.m, which is called, and in turn calls super(C, self).m().  Still using the same MRO, we see that the class following C is A, and thus A.m is called.  This is the original definition of m, so no super call is made at this point.  <\/p><p>Note how the same super expression finds a different class implementing a method depending on the class of self!  This is the crux of the cooperative super mechanism.  <\/p><\/blockquote>          <p>Quite cool indeed. <\/p>",

[I am assuming from this discussion the stories changing their relative rankings for simplicity, you can take example of flickr group photos, they also change rapidly, and order does not change there]. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnother problem is, I am page on 26 of this flickr group, and I see some fellow has posted 8 nice photos to the group. I bookmark the page, and come back later\/email it to a friend, and by the time the page is visited again, 100s of new photos has been added and the content of page 26 is now on page 29 or so, and I don't find what I was looking for.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe last consequence of this is caching difficulty. If a group has 5 thousand pages worth 30 photos each, and one more photo gets added, either the page number of the photos in each page will change for 5 thousand of those pages. This will happen on each photo being added, and there for the page can hardly be ever cached. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nI propose a solution to this problem, I call it reverse pagination, and this blog is currently using a patched django to demonstrate it. In reverse pagination, page no 0\/1 is assigned to the older page ever. When on reddit home page, and click next, you will not go to page 2, you will jump to page 20566 or something like that. The content of page 20566 will never change, only the content of latest page would be changing while new items are being added. This means all pages other than the main page can be cached for the rest of the life span of the website. And user will not face the other two problems I listed above. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nOnly downside is on the main page\/latest page, you will upto 19 items if you paginate by 10 items per page. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere is the <a href=\"http:\/\/code.djangoproject.com\/ticket\/4956\">patch<\/a> for django. Enjoy!\r\n<\/p>",

Infogami is a cleaner, simpler wiki. But unlike other wikis, it has the flexibility to handle different classes of data. Most wikis only let you store unstructured pages -- big blocks of text. Infogami lets you store semistructured data, just like ThingDB does, as well as use ThingDB's query powers to sort through it.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nEach infogami page (i.e. something with a URL) has an associated type. Each type contains a schema that states what fields can be used with it and what format those fields are in. Those are used to generate view and edit templates which can then be further customized as a particular type requires.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe result, as you can see on the Open Library site, is that one wiki contains pages that represent books, pages that represent authors, and pages that are simply wiki pages, each with their own distinct look and edit templates and set of data. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nI <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amitu.com\/blog\/2007\/june\/wikidbase-wiki-x-database\/\">wrote<\/a> about a similar structured wiki-sh idea sometime back, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nickblundell.org.uk\/projects\/wikidbase\/\">wikidBASE<\/a>.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nImagine if the entire content of wikipedia was structured.

These marks exist to allow the printer companies and governments to track and identify you -- presumably as a way to combat money counterfeiting.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n...\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nMost color laser printers made and sold today intentionally add invisible information to make it easier to determine where (and when) a particular document was printed. This seems to have been done as part of a secret deal between the United States Secret Service and the individual manufacturers. Some of the manufacturers have mentioned the existence of the tracking information in their documentation, and others haven't. None of them have explained exactly how it works or what information is conveyed. No law requires printer companies to help track printer users this way, and no law prevents them from stopping this practice or giving customers a solution to avoid being tracked.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis information is most famously known to be coded by patterns of yellow dots that the printers add to the background of all the pages they print. The yellow dots are hard to see with the naked eye, but can be seen under bright blue light or with a microscope. Their arrangement reveals which printer was used to print a particular document, and sometimes also shows when it was printed. Some of the codes have been understood while others are still mysterious, but none of the printer manufacturers has denied that the dots are intended to help track a particular document to a particular printer (or that they can actually be used for this purpose). This is a direct attack on the privacy of the owners and users of printers, and in particular, on their right to free, anonymous speech.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eff.org\/Privacy\/printers\/\">More details<\/a> with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eff.org\/about\/\">EFF<\/a>.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIs it really paranoia to ask \"what if Microsoft Windows is similarly rigged, so that US can spy on India?\" They have reasons and means and this establishes enough precedence.

In the article \u201cTen commandments for Dr. Singh\u201d, Swaminathan has come out with, \u201cThou shalt propose a law giving seniority to all cases of elected legislators over all others.\u201d\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nI think it is a brilliant suggestion. More so because of its utter simplicity. I wonder why our founding fathers did not think of this simple bit of legislation. Maybe they never imagined that a day would come when the state legislatures and also the Parliament would play host to people we would rather have behind bars.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>...<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow if getting elected to any official position becomes a catalyst for all the pending cases against them to be brought to the front burner, then only the most brain dead of criminals would like to be involved in the political process.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nI would go further to suggest that all state legislatures and the Parliament should have a fast track court established on their premises to try the worthies who have broken the law. Why should courts be located inside State Assemblies? Can\u2019t justice be served from the current premises of the High Courts? Of course it can. Just can\u2019t resist the idea that as Legislators enter the Assembly they can also see the Annexe of the High Court and know for certain that they can\u2019t escape a visit to its premises if they run foul of the law.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd for career politicians who have a lot of frivolous cases registered against them, there is nothing to despair. Because all the law would say is that, \u201call your cases will be fast tracked and tackled by a special court\u201d. So in case of complaints that are completely frivolous or are obviously the result of leading an agitation against some policy of the government they could also get some judicial respite. Immediately. And such a rule should be welcomed by those politicians who claim that they are being victimized.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThis proposal should get more attention.\r\n<\/p>",

The very <a href=\"http:\/\/www.schneier.com\/blog\/archives\/2007\/07\/privacy_and_the.html#c188976\">first comment<\/a> was:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the suggested responses to \"I've got nothing to hide\" is \"can I see your credit card bills for the last year?\" Good luck trying that when you're pulled over by a cop or when the FBI is at your door.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is quite easy to make people agree that it makes sense to have privacy from one another.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is much harder to disprove the notion that \"I've got nothing to hide from the government,\" and I don't see this essay addressing the question why individuals need privacy from the government.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThis reinforces my argument that privacy advocates are not doing their job well enough. If I was to do this job, about the first thing I will do is create awareness about the difference between the notion of privacy against government vs the privacy against citizens\/private firms\/marketers. These are so different concept when you are talking about privacy, these should have been two different words, and yet a 25 page paper written in support of privacy, that is trying to define it, evaluate its value, could not point this out. Half page long bullet list of taxonomy of privacy and such a basic thing missing, this is failure to me. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nI will do the needful, I call privacy against government \"absolute privacy\" and privacy against citizens\/private firms: \"general privacy\", or just privacy. This is the first taxonomy one should understand before one starts making further arguments for or against privacy. A lot of arguments in favor of privacy are only applicable to general privacy, and are wrongly used against absoulte privacy. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.schneier.com\/blog\/archives\/2007\/07\/privacy_and_the.html#c188977\">Moving on<\/a>:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n@Amit:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe government is not forced to collect data under the covers, it chooses to do so. This is not a problem of privacy, but of a government which is not the servant of the people (as it should be, at least in a democracy or realanarchy), but has its very own agenda.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the same way, one could argue that governmental torture should be legalized, as otherwise the government will still torture, but secretly (IIRC this argument came up on this blog before).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nKristine\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nP.S: The \"terrorist\" horseman of the apocalypse is a bit overused, especially in conjunction with \"might potentially help\". So it does not scare me\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nLet me repeat why I feel government is forced to collect data under covers: privacy is a very abused term, privacy advocates to blame mostly, and the masses are not educated. I trust politician much less than security advocates(who have failed in my thesis), if privacy-loss has widespread negative connotation in public, government would be tempted to avoid disclosing, this is the nature of democracy. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nTorture is real, privacy is made up paranoia, if you differ, I will give you my gmail password, and you courier me your chopped fingers. :-)\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nTerrorism is a funny business, if Americans have had enough of calling themselves victims of terrorism, may be, just may be, they should consider the countries really suffering from terrorism, like India for example. 10 years of evidence of direct support by Pakistan in Kashmir, and the American press still calls terrorism in India \"freedom struggle\". Imagine millions of suffering because an entire state being victim of real terrorism, and then compare with flukes like 911 that had just few thousand dead, years ago, you may get some perspective. Anyways, coming back to topic. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nLet me summarize my position. Privacy is an important issue. General privacy should be my constitutional right, no one should have right to post my emails or phone call records, on internet for example. This is not freedom of speech. This is not a IP\/copyright issue. This is a privacy issue. This is missing today. Absolute privacy, governments should have right and means to do data-mining, to go through my emails and phone records, to study demographic trends, to look for unusual activities. We as society has to come up with systems and norms to make sure these things do not get misused. If government singles me out, it is an abuse. If government does not take suitable precautions to keep my data safe, or shares it with private parties, it is an abuse. We should help build public awareness towards these issues, and participate in government's data warehouse building projects with suitable gaurds to avoid the real issues. This is missing too. A knee jerk, \"privacy is the holy grail, anything else and you are totalitarian government in making\" argument would only hurt privacy in the long run.\r\n<\/p>\r\n",

At-least it is supposed to \"exposes its faulty underpinnings\". 12 pages into it, after reading 1 million times that this argument is not valid, I am yet to see any strong argument. Schneier and group trying to brain wash people about something that might potentially help stop terrorists? \r\n<p>\r\n<\/p>\r\nWhy is privacy required? Do we need privacy? Is it our right? It would have been a good thing had there been reasons to call privacy a fundamental right, but there isn't. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about. This is fundamental. \r\n<p>\r\n<\/p>\r\nI am an advocate of privacy actually, but when I see criticism of data mining projects in the name of privacy, it sounds more like security analysts\/watchdogs are taking the wishful simpler but wrong way out of \"privacy is fundamental therefore data mining is wrong\" approach, where as they should be pointing out the details of the programs. The reasons are simple, if I have to tell a common person that government is doing something wrong, I would rather want my argument to be one sentence long rather than one para or a book long. Common people have short attention span, they know anyone, who has invested anything in any field of expertise, will want everyone to know how valuable whatever they know is, is to everybody. Basic human psychology, common people understand it, and will take the experts opinion with a grain of salt. \r\n<p>\r\n<\/p>\r\nIt is wrong for security experts to call privacy card. For one there is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amitu.com\/blog\/2006\/april\/cause-and-champions.html\">the cause vs the champions thing<\/a> going on, you take the cause of privacy, and make lame arguments in its support, all privacy supporters suffer the loss. The fact of matter is government has been collecting information on us. The automobile registration papers, the passport, the death and birth certificate, the tax papers. They are going to keep collecting information on us, no sane person would try to argue government should stop collecting any of the information I mentioned above for example. Information collection is the part of life, and we have to live with it. We have to live with the concept that there should be a comprehensive information collection system. Years of privacy advocates have really made that system sound so bad, that instead of developing such a system openly, taking citizen interest and feedback into account, government has to do this under the covers. Should government do it? Yes. Is it possible that there can be problems with the implementation? Yes. Why not there be a open source project about the same. But privacy advocates will just kill that project, and force government to do it under covers, which actually leads to systems that are under scrutinized, and bad for the privacy in the first place. \r\n<p>\r\n<\/p>\r\nLet there be a data collection agency.

Think of it as a long-overdue public service. That is, who among us hasn't felt the double-edged sword of our media age: So much video from TV, DVDs, the Internet and even cell phones ... but too little time to watch it all? The Minisode Network has a solution. Launched in June as a broadband channel on the MySpace site, it offers, for our streaming pleasure, episodes of vintage Sony Pictures Television series like 'Silver Spoons,' 'Starsky & Hutch,' 'Diff'rent Strokes' and even Ricki Lake's talk show.\"<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nNow this is innovation! :-)\r\n<\/p>\r\n",

These collapsed objects are so dense that a teaspoon of material inside would weigh many tons. However, it is another remarkable property of black holes that the more massive they are, the less dense they need be when they form. For example, the density of the black hole formed by the collapse of an object 100 million times as massive as our Sun need only be equal to the density of water. An object of larger mass will collapse to form a black hole at a point when it is even less dense. If you keep on extrapolating, you will find that the density required to form a black hole with a mass equal to the mass of the observable universe would be roughly the same as the average density of matter in the universe! We may be living inside a black hole.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nWow! Interesting if true. Another para about blackholes:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nYou may notice that I referred to a black hole as \"hiding\" a singularity at its center. The reason is that at the outskirts of a black hole is a mathematically defined surface we call the \"event horizon,\" which shields our view of what happens to objects that fall into the hole. Inside the event horizon, everything must eventually hit the ominous singularity. Outside the event horizon, objects can escape. While an observer unlucky enough to fall into a black hole will notice nothing special at all as he or she (soon to be \"it\") crosses the event horizon, an observer watching the process from far away sees something very different. Time slows down for the observer freely falling in the vicinity of the event horizon, relative to an observer located far away. As a result, the falling observer appears from the outside to slow down as he or she nears the event horizon. The closer the falling observer gets to the event horizon, the slower is his or her clock relative to the outside observer's. <strong>While it may take the falling observer a few moments (local time) to cross the event horizon<\/strong>\u2014where, I repeat, nothing special happens and nothing special sits\u2014<strong>it will take an eternity as observed by someone on the outside<\/strong>. The infalling object appears to become frozen in time.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nEmphasis mine. What it means is nothing can fall in a black hole in any finite amount of time, so nothing can be inside event horizon that was not already there. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nUPDATED: Last paragraph actually stated a solution for <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black_hole_information_paradox\">black hole information paradox<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amitu.com\/blog\/2007\/june\/i-was-right-about-black-holes\/\">More<\/a>.\r\n<\/p>",

            "content": "<p>\r\nCame across this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.devchix.com\/2007\/06\/09\/let%e2%80%99s-all-evolve-past-this-the-barriers-women-face-in-tech-communities\/\">interesting article<\/a> about whys of women not enough interested in tech story. If you can tolerate the numerous I-s and me-s in the first four paragraph, there are interesting things in it. Its a long article but the gist of it is:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Men are generally very good at ignoring bad behavior.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is both a blessing and a curse. In my most recent office environment, we had situations where a male colleague\u2019s behavior was abrasive in one of these three ways mentioned. \u201cThat sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked another male colleague. \u201cYeah, but I just ignore it. That\u2019s just the way he is. He is always like that\u201d He responded. This is what I\u2019ve seen as the general male way of coping with this poor communication style.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt\u2019s a blessing that many men can ignore it, in the sense that most men do not get caught up in deep analysis of why this person said a specific thing, and what this person could have really meant, etc. When almost everything is taken at face value, and not over analyzed, the ability to ignore communication issues makes it is easier to resolve the simple issues, and move on. I have seen some women in office environments do the over analysis, and take offense when there never was one given. I don\u2019t see men do this very often, and it makes communication quicker and easier.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIgnoring communication issues is also a curse because one obnoxious person is allowed complete freedom to make excessive noise, be rude and disruptive, or explicitly offensive. Most men, online or in the office, will ignore it. Most women will notice it but not say or do anything about it, for a variety of reasons which are tangential to this article. The offender often thrives on the fact that no one told them to stop, so they continue. Sometimes the offender is not socially adept enough to pick up on the fact that ignoring implies intolerance at some level. They somehow missed the message most three year olds learn: \u201cI\u2019m ignoring you because I don\u2019t like your behavior\u201d, so they continue the intolerable behavior.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is so prevalent in online tech communities that it is the primary reason why many women do not participate. The poor communication and behavior of even one boorish, ego-driven, elitist, socially inept geek is just simply intolerable for most women. Women generally tend to assume that everyone will be conscious of and annoyed by this behavior. Men tend to assume that everyone will ignore it. This causes problems in offices as well as in online communities, where women will complain about such behavior, and men will issue responses such as \u201ctoughen-up\u201d, or \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d, because this is how they cope with the problem. A female-friendly group addresses and tries to resolve these issues, while the average group ignores it until\/unless the person does something heinous. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nWell said. I have only this thing to add, if you see a guy cracks a joke on you and people are smiling, it has got little with you and more with the smartness\/dumbness of what has been said. You can say he was insensitive, or others should have help, but in this situation, you are only the context. Also every time you say\/think the words I\/me\/my, imagine a virtual beep, and try to avoid it, as it can only be either of boasting, or of over analysis. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the article:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nApparently there are males online, in tech communities, who still believe that, like the cigar rooms of the Victorian Era, tech rooms should be male-only. Back then, the predominant purpose of smoking cigars in a common room was to have male-only space, and similarly today, the purpose of the demeaning and fight-provoking attempts is to maintain the male-only presence of some online tech spaces. I know for a fact this happens with intent in some online chat rooms and message boards. It is not simply an act of oblivion, but a concentrated, misogynistic effort between like-minded men to keep women out.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThis can not be further from truth. Its just I-me-over analysis speaking. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nBottom line is this: technical field is all about technical correctness. Computers\/electrical circuits\/engines\/airplanes dont' understand tone, they understand correctness. If you want to succeed in technical field, you will have to learn to ignore what does not matter(emotions), and focus on what does(technology and correctness). Think if they are right or wrong, not of the manner in which they communicated. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nEmotion is the way to the dark side, blind you it will. \r\n<\/p>",

            "content": "<p>\r\nOne of the most important factor in a users percieved performance of a website is the initial page load time. Initial load time depends on backend performance, time it took for the backend to generate the HTML page, and front end performance, the time it takes for the browser to download and render the HTML and all its dependencies. And it turns out that browsers typically take much longer to download dependencies than the original HTML page, due to browser pipelining. Look at the chart below: \r\n<a href=\"\/static2\/frontend-performance.gif\"><img src=\"\/static2\/frontend-performance.gif\" width=400px><\/a>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs one can see, most of the time is spent in downloading the images, especially problematic for image heavy sites. Read <a href=\"http:\/\/yuiblog.com\/blog\/category\/performance\/\">Yahoo! UI Blog's entries<\/a> on this topic for futher details. \r\n <\/p>\r\n<p> \r\nGoogle recently released <a href=\"http:\/\/googlewebtoolkit.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/google-web-toolkit-14-release-candidate.html\">GWT 1.4<\/a>, and one of the features introduced in this release is <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-web-toolkit\/wiki\/ImageBundleDesign\">ImageBundle<\/a>. The basic idea is to bundle all the images into one at the server side, and use CSS sprite technique to render them. Inspired by it, I just finished an implementation of \"Image Bundling\" for Django. Here is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amitu.com\/projects\/django-image-bundle\/demo\/\">demo<\/a> of the same. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangosnippets.org\/snippets\/278\/\">original template<\/a> to generate the page is here. Look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amitu.com\/static2\/e0f4895fdf1f772705d71320c24b5ef1.jpg\">bundled image<\/a>. And the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangosnippets.org\/snippets\/279\/\">image bundle template tag library<\/a> can be downloaded from djangosnippets.com. As an added bonus the size of bundled image is about 70% of the total size of individual images, so one can save both total bandwidth, and number of http requests. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is still the first cut solution. Both this and Google's ImageBundle face an issue when dealing with images with padding, google suggests to avoid padding, or put a wrapper div around the image and put the padding on it. Another issue is images in CSS. They are to be handled slightly differently, but to still keep the output image count to one, some kind of bundle naming is to be done. Google's approach here is creating bundles and using them as two separate steps, I have tried to combine the two together for greater flexibility. \r\n<\/p>",

            "content": "<p>\r\nThis is a very old news for all directly affected. About a year and a half back, I started <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amitu.com\/blog\/2006\/01\/introducing-labelr.html\">this project<\/a> to allow category support to blogger hosted blogs. It went well in intial testing, and near the end I had about 300 blogs using it. It was a django powered website, and hosted on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dreamhost.com\/r.cgi?135689\">dreamhost<\/a>, and for some reason dreamhost was just not reliable enough for this service. One of the specialty of this service was if it goes down, it takes down all those 300 blogs with it. After a series or reported incidents I was forced to shut it down, for lack of any technical solution, as I did not have time and money to get a new hosting service. So here is an apology for all the people using labelr, for its shutting down abruptly. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe culprit here was my stern requirements, \"not a minute downtime\", especially difficult for shared hosting services. Dreamhost should not really be faulted, as they do not officially support django, and are ideally suited for PHP based and static websites. They are still my favorite for running mediawiki and keeping backups [they give huge amount of space] and are really cheap. There support staff is usually good, so please do not look at this take down as to indicate too badly on them. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nOff late I am using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webfaction.com\/shared_hosting?affiliate=vakow\">webfaction<\/a> for hosting my blog, and other django applications. They are really seamless to start, I had the website running in less than 20 minutes since I got the account activated, including all learning, configuration etc. They give you your own instance of http, which is really cool. Trac is much easier to install with webfaction than dreamhost for example. If you are looking for a place to host django website, I highly recomment webfaction, for mediawiki, enormous amount of disk to archieve all your mails, or for running wordpress\/mediawiki, go for dreamhost [they have the best backup solution I have seen implemented, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.dreamhosters.com\/kbase\/index.cgi?area=2585\">snapshots<\/a>]. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nI intend to release the source code of labelr, but its right now in terrible shape, may be I will write a few articles about the specific things worth taking away from that work. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo dear labelr users, sorry for the shutdown, and thanks for the enormous amount of support and interest I recieved from you guys, I still have more than thousand unread labelr beta request in my mail box.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd comments are not working as of now, so please mail as of now. \r\n<\/p>",

Of those, 16% were in the public domain, and 9% were in copyright, and in print. That means, 75% of the books Google would scan are out of print but presumptively under copyright.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe publishers and Google already have deals for the 9%. And being in the public domain, no one needs a deal for the 16%. So the only thing the publishers might be complaining about is the 75% which are out of print and presumptively under copyright.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith respect to these, Google intends to index the books, and make them searchable. If a hit comes through the search engine, Google offers snippets of the text relevant to the search. The page includes links to libraries where the book might be borrowed; it includes links to book stores where the book might be purchased. And, I take it, if the \u201cpublishers\u201d were to choose to publish the book again, it would also include a link to that publisher.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, any author who wants to be removed from this index can be removed. As with Google on the net, anyone can opt out.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2007\/06\/07\/publishing-exec-steals-google-laptops-in-silly-demonstration\/\">Context<\/a>.<\/p>",

You haven't read this Boston Globe article:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.boston.com\/news\/nation\/articles\/2006\/04\/30\/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws\/\" title=\"boston.com\">Bush challenges hundreds of laws<\/a> [boston.com]?<br \/><br \/><blockquote><div>President Bush has quietly claimed the authority to disobey more than 750 laws enacted since he took office, asserting that he has the power to set aside any statute passed by Congress when it conflicts with his interpretation of the Constitution.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>Legal scholars say the scope and aggression of Bush's assertions that he can bypass laws represent a concerted effort to expand his power at the expense of Congress, upsetting the balance between the branches of government. The Constitution is clear in assigning to Congress the power to write the laws and to the president a duty ''to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" Bush, however, has repeatedly declared that he does not need to ''execute\" a law he believes is unconstitutional.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>Bush is the first president in modern history who has never vetoed a bill, giving Congress no chance to override his judgments. Instead, he has signed every bill that reached his desk, often inviting the legislation's sponsors to signing ceremonies at which he lavishes praise upon their work.<br \/><br \/>Then, after the media and the lawmakers have left the White House, Bush quietly files ''signing statements\" -- official documents in which a president lays out his legal interpretation of a bill for the federal bureaucracy to follow when implementing the new law. The statements are recorded in the federal register.<br \/><br \/>In his signing statements, Bush has repeatedly asserted that the Constitution gives him the right to ignore numerous sections of the bills -- sometimes including provisions that were the subject of negotiations with Congress in order to get lawmakers to pass the bill. He has appended such statements to more than one of every 10 bills he has signed.<\/div><\/blockquote>Bush knows exactly what he's doing. Calling him a moron is simply underestimating his gross disrespect for your freedoms and the Constitution, and is a distraction from his intent to give himself more and more power while taking away your rights.<\/div><\/div><\/blockquote><div class=\"commentBody\"><div id=\"comment_body_15804376\"><\/div> <\/div>The question much worthy of consideration \"Can they do it?\" than \"Are they doing it?\".

I&#8217;d order the government to publish on the Internet continuous debates on all important issues. And I&#8217;d let the proponents of each side manage their sides of the debate. I&#8217;d order a team of independent researchers to attach links to any factual claims so you citizens can see for yourselves who is trying to hoodwink you. Both sides would be free to make any claims they like. But the independent team would always point the reader to the facts. Over time, the compulsive liars would lose all credibility and be pushed aside by their own people.<\/p> <p>As President, I would rarely take sides on the major issues. My job would be to bring the best arguments on all sides of every issue to the citizens and help them make up their own minds. My administration would make it a top priority to improve how the government communicates with its citizens. And that might require making the information more entertaining or at least easier to digest. As a general rule I would say that if the citizens don&#8217;t understand both sides of all important issues, I have failed as President. If the people need simple charts and graphs, I&#8217;ll provide them. If they need puppet shows, I&#8217;ll stick my hand in a tube sock and hide behind my desk.

Google has been rather pro Microsoft in their software offerings till late, though they try their best to cater to their interests in browser market.

First today Google <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itwire.com.au\/content\/view\/4434\/937\/\">announced partnership<\/a> with Dell to bundle Google  software with PCs. To add to it, Google has decided to do a psychological warfare with Microsoft by supporting Linux for a few of their applications. Linux users should not jump with joy though, as Google stands to gain very little by a gain in Linux users, and this gambit is almost purely for blackmail\/extortion [both these applications must have been in the process of porting since some time, just that Google has decided to launch them now to drive shiver through Microsoft]. Also Google almost never announces that they are working on some application before launching it, Google Earth for Linux is their first pre-announcement. Google Earth Linux is supposed to be a rewrite using Qt etc, which might well has been done to add Mac support.<br \/><br \/>Microsoft has much to worry. Google worked very closely with CodeWeaver on Picasa port, offering them a <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/wine.html\">large<\/a> amount of software help, it would be a trivial matter for Google to just buy CodeWeaver and make it free [making my wish come true].

Not in the Haight-Ashbury\/Timothy Leary\/late-period Beatles kind of way, but in the sense of the Kevin Bacon game. The sociologist Stanley Milgram made this clear in the 1960's when he took pairs of people unknown to each other, separated by a continent, and asked one of the pair to send a package to the other -- but only by passing the package to a person he knew, who could then send the package only to someone he knew, and so on. On average, it took only six mailings -- the famous six degrees of separation -- for the package to reach its intended destination. <p>Looked at this way, President Bush is only a few steps away from Osama bin Laden (in the 1970's he ran a company partly financed by the American representative for one of the Qaeda leader's brothers). And terrorist hermits like the Unabomber are connected to only a very few people. So much for finding the guilty by association.<\/p> <p>A second problem with the spy agency's apparent methodology lies in the way terrorist groups operate and what scientists call the \"strength of weak ties.\" As the military scientist Robert Spulak has described it to me, you might not see your college roommate for 10 years, but if he were to call you up and ask to stay in your apartment, you'd let him. This is the principle under which sleeper cells operate: there is no communication for years. Thus for the most dangerous threats, the links between nodes that the agency is looking for simply might not exist.<\/p><\/blockquote> <p>(<a target=\"_new\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ostina.org\/html\/bridges\/article.htm?article=1298\">This<\/a>, by him, is also worth reading.)<\/p><\/blockquote><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

If goventment decided to open 100 schools, 75 of which are in the area which covers 75 percent of the population, would it be unfair on the rest of the 25%? How is it different from reservation. 75% population deciding government should give them 75% share in all allotments it has say over, is only democratic.<br \/><br \/>Now the core issue: \"lower caste\" people are deprived. They are a lot in numbers. And they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ambedkar.org\/\">hate upper caste<\/a>. And they hate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onlinejournal.com\/artman\/publish\/article_603.shtml\">Gandhi<\/a>. This hate, which is what is being channeled has been conspeciously missing in all the whole debate. Politicians reconize this hatredness, they fuel it, and reap the benefits in votes. Politicans are not the cause, they are the affect.<br \/><br \/>We keep on saying education is what makes people think strainght, and yet never question our assumption that all those economically backward classes of society are making sound judgement about who is responsible for their misery. We think that they know that we are not responsible for their misery and that that they know their only problem is uneducation. They do not know that. We may take long to educate them in general, but we can educate them about the fact that we are not the reason of their misery much more easily. We can do that by ending this enviorenment of hate. We have to offer the olive branch of reservation, that alone will convince them that we are sincere.<br \/><br \/>A lot of people burnt themselves, because they mistenly fell for the \"minority\" reservation name that is used for it. People think that \"minorities\" are getting disprotionate reservation in schools. The problem is they are not \"minority\" despite being called so. This confusion is the main reason for the angst of \"majority\" hindus. We are equally \"uneducated\". We hate them for this reason. We hate them for being the reason for our percieved loss in opportunities.<br \/><br \/>This is a classic case of divide and rule. We hate them. They hate us. We fight over who would get bigger share of 100 seats when we combined should be fighting to get our deserved 1000 seats. Politicians are screwing us, not by alloting us smaller share, but by making us think counting shares is what the real issue is about.<br \/><br \/>Let us not ask who gets how much, lets ask if the total we are getting combined is enough? Does governemt need to spend more on education? Is it the funds that are stopping those extra schools or ineffeciency [and corruption] of fund allotment? Let us take the fight to them. <\/p><p>Lets take reservation as an opportunity to make friends.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

Realistically speaking I&#8217;m not... I only do one thing after another, no matter how many windows I have opened.<\/p> <p>It&#8217;s like this: whenever I upload something to my server, or download a big file from somewhere, <strong>I&#8217;m switching to another task<\/strong>... say, photoshopping a picture. While theoretically this saves time (when you program too much, you hard-wire &#8220;optimization&#8221; into your brain!), I&#8217;ll mostly end up dabbling with the other task far longer than the download will take... so basically, I&#8217;m getting back to the old task after 30 minutes, even though the download only took 5 minutes.<\/p> <p>At my last job (one big open room, a phone on every desk!), after a while I made it a rule to <strong>never do more than two tasks at the same time<\/strong>, no matter how smallish the third or fourth task would appear. &#8217;Cause here&#8217;s what happens if you &#8220;multitask.&#8221; Say, you&#8217;re programming something on site A. Then the manager comes along and wants you to upload site B (maybe your team agreed on putting up a red flag on the desk if you&#8217;re busy, but your manager retains the right to overrule the flag with &#8220;ASAP&#8221; tasks).<br \/>Soon thereafter an Outlook alert pops up. Oh, it&#8217;s just one of those office joke mails &#8211; but if you don&#8217;t read them you&#8217;ll send around the same joke a month later, and everybody flames you. So you quickly glance through the mail, and then you notice the attachment doesn&#8217;t load properly. You end up walking over to your sysadmin, who has a problem with a script at that moment. So you help him with the script, but you don&#8217;t know the answer, so the two of you google for a bit. You find a page in the results which isn&#8217;t necessary what you were looking for but it seems interesting, so you... OK, you get the point.<\/p> <p><em>Do you still remember the original task I was talking of?<\/em> Right, site A... it didn&#8217;t progress at all for the last hour. And that upload for site B was finished since, well, you don&#8217;t really know, and you&#8217;re not even sure you uploaded the necessary 12 files, or just 11, because just when you started the upload, your manager came along.<\/p> <p>No, this ain&#8217;t multitasking... that&#8217;s chaintasking. And it&#8217;s almost useless, though it may make us feel like we&#8217;re achieving more. What really happens is that we&#8217;re downsizing our attention frames &#8211; proud to have achieved 20 tasks that day, we might have only gotten around to do <em>one or two<\/em> properly.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/p><p>On <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.outer-court.com\/archive\/2006-05-09-n82.html\">Google Blogscpoed<\/a>.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

Notice that <code>grep -v grep<\/code> is no longer part of the pipeline; instead, it has been removed and <code>grep \"ssh-agent\"<\/code> has been changed to <code>grep \"[s]sh-agent\"<\/code>.  This single <code>grep<\/code> command ends up doing the same thing as <code>grep ssh-agent | grep -v grep<\/code>; can you figure out why? <\/p><a name=\"code10\"><b>Listing 10.

If you've decided that a <code>grep \"ssh-agent\"<\/code> and <code>grep \"[s]sh-agent\"<\/code> should match the exact same lines of text, you are correct.  So why do they generate different results when the output of <code>ps<\/code> is piped to them?  Here's how it works: when you use <code>grep \"[s]sh-agent\"<\/code>, you change how the <code>grep<\/code> command appears in the <code>ps<\/code> process list. By doing so, you prevent <code>grep<\/code> from matching itself, since the <code>[s]sh-agent<\/code> string doesn't match the <code>[s]sh-agent<\/code> regular expression.  Isn't that brilliant?  If you still don't get it, play around with <code>grep<\/code> a bit more and you'll get it soon enough.   <\/blockquote><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

(This commitment of OPEC to dollar oil sales was secured in the 1970s by a secret agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia, before the two countries began to drift apart over Israel and other issues.) <8> <\/p><p> The chief reason why dollars are more than pieces of green paper is that countries all over the world need them for purchases, principally of oil.

I assumed that it is because it is rush period which it was. Then I finally got the ticket and reached home couple of days before diwali. Almost. I sleep in the trains, even if its a 30 hr journey, and I knew I would reach my destination at around 6 in the evening, so was sleeping, train stopped and everyone went out, it was varansi and I stayed in the train for an hour or so dozing off. Went down and realized the train has halted for good. Further enquiry at station told me that that was the first train that was allowed after 4-5 days when trains were completely stopped. I had absolutely no idea, and mind you I check rediff.com and timesofindia.com almost every half an hr [rss feeds]. Why were the trains stopped? Because of ongoing curfew in Mau. I had to go to Azamgarh, tried to take a bus, entire route that went through Mau was blocked. Entire week I tried to learn more whats happening, are the trains running, will I be able to go back on the train I book ticket on etc, I did not find a single mention of Mau in the news channels. <br \/><br \/>I heard about killings. I heard from my dad, who had heard from other sources. I heard from one of my servants, who claims he has escaped personally from a train, walked some 20kms in farms, and came back to his village, he says most in the train died. Later on trains were stopped. I heard it from nearly everywhere, and yet no mention of these in ToI or Dainik Jagran that I used to get there, dainik atleast used to mention the curfew, ToI had no news whatsoever. <br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com\/2006\/04\/indifference-vs-incompetence.html#c114596396577493644\">AC(DC) says<\/a>:<br \/><blockquote>We've had this discussion. First you said that a websearch  wouldn't result in anything because it has been censored. <\/blockquote><br \/>I predicted that websearch also should not result in anything as I had not seen any coverage. I was wrong and there were some mention of such. <br \/><br \/><blockquote>Then when the websearch actually yielded stuff, you assumed that to be the truth and said that the mainstream media wasn't reporting it, or was reporting the \"censored\" version.<\/blockquote><br \/>That is actually an assumption you are making. I was reading the coverage on web to do further research in what happened, and I could not find anything interesting. A news here and there about wide scale riots, many others about denial. I hard a total of 1 story about some\/few BJP MP walking out of parliament during my 5 day stay in a place where nearly everyone on the street is telling me that people are getting butchered less than 100 Km from where I am staying. I do not know which to believe, it was not purely rumor as trains and buses were stopped, but what it was? ToI and TV News failed me on that. <br \/><br \/>BTW there is an interesting trick, I call it bracketing. You do this, take the person whose view you are going to argue against, and bracket that view to a category that you can easily criticize. Oh you researched on the web, no oh you read stuff on the web, no no no.. oh you assumed you found on the web to be true, yeah that is the perfect statement. You bracket me in the category of people who \"assume the stuff they find on the web to be true\" and obviously your work is done, no further labour required in equating them to morons. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vandruff.com\/art_converse.html\">Art of conversational terrorism<\/a>. What you said *anything* in the favour of religion, you must be the strongest supporter of all religios beliefs, let me criticize you taking the weakest argument made by any religion supporter. <br \/><br \/>Finally:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>Agreed, that the MSM doesn't report everything, but there might be factors like economics, and incompetence rather than a grand-mega conspiracy theory. Or are you just going to contradict yourself here?<\/blockquote><br \/>I guess you are referring to the grand-mega conspiracy theory I was talking about [as of now]. [Neither is she]. If someone comes and takes any of what I have said in the first two para as evidence I have no problems with that, I stand by it, not all is known on what happened and it should be investigated.<div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

Moreover, I don't think it's useful.<br \/><br \/>It comes back to the same old razor: \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence.\" And it becomes clearer with every passing day that incompetence is more than adequate to explain our government's inability to react quickly enough to circumstances across our country. <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"Indifference\" is a charge that defies empirical data, because we can never truly know the hearts of others. \"Incompetence,\" however, can be quantified: So let's keep our eye on the ball. There's no benefit to anyone by getting personal, and by claiming that \"the government doesn't care about poor people or is dead set against a particular religion.\" It's much more useful to make it crystal clear that the government has been just plain negligent, and that their negligence led directly to the deaths of thousands of people -- because a negligent government is something that, with enough support, we can change. <\/span><br \/><br \/>Incompetent journalists, criminally negligent journalists or liars who are complicit in the mass deception of the Indian people; there are no other ways whatsoever to describe the men and women who comprise the news institutions of India. From the hired face you see every day on the CNN's of India and aaj tak to the journalism interns. Every person currently employed in the corporate   media today has some soul searching to do.<br \/><br \/>The members of today's news media warrant outrage from the people of the world who have fallen victim to their despicable practices. With each new day brings new crimes while a false sense of reality is passed to Indian people via our media. In olden times when street justice was the norm we would be dragging our beloved anchormen and women into the streets and having a public execution, for these people have been the empowering force behind the most despicable and<br \/>dangerous Indian administration in history.<br \/><br \/>NOTE: I use this word: Lie. Not mislead, not mistake, misspoke, neglected to inform, omitted, left out, misrepresent, factually incorrect etc. Part of the definition of a lie is to leave a false impression. These people lie to us. <br \/><br \/>I (we) should be angry. There has been too much writing and discussion about the state of the media. The good people who are trying to address the problems with the media have been dignified, intellectualized, soft spokened and IGNORED. IT IS TIME TO GET LOUD! It is time to get angry! It is time to stop the madness! With dignity and fairness the media critics and watchdogs tried to alert the public of the information being withheld by our news media. Dignified and standard methods of communication can not defeat the hugeness of false reality that emanates from our TVs, and news papers. <br \/><br \/>With dignity Media wrote about many events. They did their own investigations, held hearings and they exposed the complicity of our ruling government and its administration in those events. They wrote with dignity until their fingers hurt. They spoke with dignity until their voices gave out. They filmed documentaries until they ran out of film. They were ignored, suppressed, murdered in the literal sense. The Congress administration has devastated this nation and the world. Everything that is Indian is being destroyed while the media continue to sell catch phrases and concepts to public like \"democracy\" and \"security\"; empty words that in most cases have described the opposite of what is actually taking place. This is the stuff that ignites revolutions! Where are all the revolutionaries? Where is the outrage? Where is the anger? From the environmental terrorism and no way that our government is sensitive to this topic and failure of the dignified commissions to bring about any major changes this in itself will kill more people than all terrorist combined have issues like these go unmentioned by the media. The fact is that the not many Indian public can believe there is a reality other than the one presented on their television, news papers and radios. This, in essence, gives the broadcast media the power to control perceived reality. They abuse this power.<br \/><br \/>In response to this article the Government supporters are going to talk about the liberal media and they will sarcastically start to bring up menacing entities that control the media. I don't care who controls the media. It is a secondary issue. As long as you know that the deception is taking place you can counter it. As long as you know that there is a pickpocket in the crowd you can protect yourself. It is a bonus if you can identify him\/her. It is a double bonus if you can<br \/>arrest and convict him\/her. Suffice to know you are being lied to. Protect yourself Get angry.<br \/>One thing that we do know is who is lying to us. They splash their names all over your life. They lied about virtually every aspect of the Mau Attacks (just for your information Mau is a very small town some where in UP where over 100s  of Hindus literally got butchered by Muslim fanatics who entered the trains and killed almost all the passengers) and I am sure lots of people would try to justify this as an act done by media to avert greater harm or probably media<br \/>was ordered to do so by our very prestigious government . But what about our right to know, what<br \/>about solace to the victims and their families and what about their unanswered sense of vengeance or the most required pressure on judiciary and our lethargic police system to wake up and find these gruesome murderers who are roaming free in our society, our government which promises us safety and media which can ensure this, are betraying us on our face, isn't this outrageous.<br \/><br \/>Enough is enough!<br \/><br \/>I am asking you to get angry. Get furious. When you turn on your TV and find that the top story<br \/>is one that you used to have to read about in a supermarket tabloid, ask yourself what news is NOT being reported. Then try to figure out how the on screen pretend journalist keeps a straight face as they try to pretend that a domestic crime is national news and worth deep thoughtful journalistic discussion.<br \/><br \/>We have to educate the public about the people who lie to them every day. You should be furious. You should feel rage. You should do something. At least spread the word!<\/blockquote> <\/p><p>Emphasis mine.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

            "content": "<p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div>Was just reading <a href=\"http:\/\/youthcurry.blogspot.com\/2006\/04\/actor-to-activist.html\">Rashmi<\/a> on the recently in news <a href=\"http:\/\/www.narmada.org\/\">Narmada Bachao Andolan<\/a>, found this bit interesting:<br \/><blockquote>Aamir's appeal is \"rehabilitate them properly\". Which is what the Supreme Court has decreed. It is what the NBA of 2006 is also asking for, although in the past it opposed big dams on principle. Now perhaps this opposition was based on sound reasons but as far as the thirsty people of 4 Gujarat and city dwellers like me were concerned, NBA appeared to be 'anti progress'.<br \/><br \/>And therefore, as time went by, Medha Patkar got embedded into our consciousness as a 'troublemaker'. What she was making trouble about - exactly - was never completely clear. Again it could be the complexity of the issue or my lack of receptiveness or the inability of NBA to <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dams.org\/report\/reaction\/reaction_nba.htm\">communicate it<\/a> effectively.<\/blockquote><br \/>I keep on saying to people, if you are supporting a cause, your biggest enemy might just be the other supporters of the cause. Democracy is a bullshit, there is no power in numbers, people are not fools, truth prevails. If one of the supporters of the cause you are supporting becomes too vocal, many things happen, that supporter may become the representative, just because they are vocal, and if they are assholes, they will go down and put a permanent spot on your cause. You lose with you enemy hundread times, and you still can go on with fight, your supports supporting you all the more, you lose once with your brother, your whole support base splits up. Other things happen too, for example, what is Medha Patekar but for NBA? All the attention she is getting. Who would not want to hear \"<a href=\"http:\/\/akshargram.com\/nirantar\/0805\/samvaad?PHPSESSID=c27d003b22c801045d8a7c81dd62a8a8\">&#2350;&#2375;&#2343;&#2366; &#2340;&#2375;&#2332;&#2364;&#2340;&#2352;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2352;, &#2360;&#2366;&#2361;&#2360;&#2368; &#2324;&#2352; &#2360;&#2361;&#2344;&#2358;&#2368;&#2354; &#2310;&#2306;&#2342;&#2379;&#2354;&#2344;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2368; &#2352;&#2361;&#2368; &#2361;&#2376;&#2306;&#2404;<\/a>\" about them. Every movement has supporters, some religious like one of my room mates, supporters know movements require money, who do they give money to but the champions? She might like the attention if she is not taking direct advantage of the money. I have nothing against her, no proofs, but I do know it is hard to not make it a personal cause, and get into the situation where someone's point of view must prevail, and there is very little guiding this personal point of view to be in sync with the larger cause they are championing. There are other problems, if a cause has a champion, other sympaths sit down thinking the champion is doing their job. The original champion might consider an ego issue to see a new champion emerge, and possible doubt the original champions modus operandi. There is more that happens. If I support a cause, and see the champion making mistakes, and if I try to tell them they are wrong, I will have to use public media. If the enemy of the cause know that I am publicly critisizing the champion of the cause depite being a support of a cause, the enemy will use this against the cause. Then again if champion makes a mistake, lets say in their argument, enemy will use it against the whole cause.<br \/><br \/>Veda says passion is the biggest enemy of truth. A selfless, egoless, passionless persuit to the truth is the only way to get it. As soon as a person gets associated with the truth, you can say goodbye to the truth.<br \/><br \/>Consider this, I have been hearing about Narmada movement since years, if not decades. Medha Patekar has been there since the beginning(?), and yet, the biggest thing they are supporting: \"rehabilitate them properly\", becomes shadowed compared to Medha Patekar. Enviorenment concern is a concern, but unless some env scientist shows me a report specifically giving some estimates about the how long before the dam will break down, or what would be the enviorenmental impact of this if all the affected are suitably rehabilitated; how can one consider it credible. <br \/><br \/>No one has the right on land, government can take your land whenever they deem fit (in India), and all you are entitled to is suitable compensation, possible rehab. Supreme court is with NBA on this. Every supporter I know of NBA says that is the bottom line. And yet the strongest theme, that would have gotten the strongest support, and silenced all the opponents had been compromised by enviorenmental cause and other bullshit. I am sorry, I am with the peoples right, but hoarish tendency of trying to accumulate as many sympathy points as possible, that Medha Pathkar deemed the way to go about this issue, has diluted thier stand in front of Indian population at large, lead to lot of confusion, and is the reason all the people to suffer if they did. If the champions is incompetent, the cause can slip away.<\/p><p>I am not a \"leftist\" [quoting Rashmi: by leftist type I mean people who raise question marks but do not provide alternative solutions], so here is the solution, not for or against NBA, but for how to fight incase you are for the NBA: find out the number of people who would be affected. As per <a href=\"http:\/\/www.narmada.org\/sardarsarovar.html\">www.narmada.org<\/a> sardar sarovar dam alone would displace 1 million people. Scrap the current narmada.org site main page, go out and varify the credibility of this figure, and get people to acknowledge it. Put the names of the people if possible. Make sure everyone talking in favor NBA is either talking about \"the number of people displaced and demanding govt to either do proper rehab for them or scrap the dam\" or is considered the enemy of your cause. Medha Patekar: Be serious, do the homework, or sit at home and enjoy the movies, a half hearted effort out of sympathy only hurts.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

What do I do, how do I begin. Have written 30 page letters full lenght page love letters to girlfriends before, tho. Any suggestions?<\/b><\/i> (<a href=\"profile\/1334855\">Amit<\/a>)<br \/><br \/>30 page letters....! Shit, give some pointers to Saurabh, will you?<br \/><br \/>Here's my theory: all cool ideas can be expressed in one sentence. Explanations are only necessary if there is a disagreement or a failure to <i>understand<\/i> it - i.e. a failure to see how the idea is applicable in life.<br \/><br \/>Example: the God question, above. The idea that I have is simple - God doesn't exist. What else is there to say about it? Nothing, unless somebody says, \"no, dude, God exists, look, He created the universe, isn't that proof?\" Then you explain why that can't be. Or somebody'll say, \"So what if God doesn't exist?\", to which you can launch into a rant about how it's important for people to stop believing in God, because trusting in fiction does a lot of harm.<br \/><br \/>All the movies you've seen, the books you've read, have a one-sentence idea behind them. The movie or the book is an attempt to get the audience to <i>understand<\/i> the idea by showing how it's applicable to real people. The understanding only happens when the idea is repeatedly tested by antagonistic people and situations, and is <i>shown<\/i> to be true. (Think of it this way: a movie without any conflict would <i>suck<\/i>.)<br \/><br \/>So the next time you want to write, play Devil's Advocate to your idea. Think what the nay-sayers would say. Then blast them to smithereens. It's crazy fun.<br \/><\/blockquote><\/p><p>Interesting. Soon after asking her this question I realize one of the biggest problem in writing for me is who am I writing it for. That girlfriend letter thing, I can write quite much as I knew how she thinks, but when I am writing for this blog for example, I am not too sure. But she is right about the devils advocacy bit, that can give some opportunities to write. <\/p><br \/>So why do I have like a million blogs?

It's basically a luxury item: for $139 you can avoid the drive to the airport. But, of course, security screeners are required for passengers, and that's causing some concern:<\/p> <blockquote>At the request of U.S. Helicopter's executives, the federal Transportation Security Administration set up a checkpoint, with X-ray and bomb-detection machines, to screen passengers and their luggage at the heliport. <p>The security agency is spending $560,000 this year to operate the checkpoint with a staff of eight screeners and is considering adding a checkpoint at the heliport at the east end of 34th Street. The agency's involvement has drawn criticism from some elected officials.<\/p> <p>\"The bottom line here is that there are not enough screeners to go around,\" said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. \"The fact that we are taking screeners that are needed at airports to satisfy a luxury market on the government's dime is a problem.\"<\/p><\/blockquote> <p>This is not a security problem; it's an economics problem. And it's a good illustration of the concept of \"externalities.\" An externality is an effect of a decision not borne by the decision-maker. In this example, U.S. Helicopter made a business decision to offer this service at a certain price. And customers will make a decision about whether or not the service is worth the money. But there is more to the cost than the $139. The cost of that checkpoint is an externality to both U.S. Helicopter and its customers, because the $560,000 spent on the security checkpoint is paid for by taxpayers. Taxpayers are effectively subsidizing the true cost of the helicopter trip.<\/p> <p>The only way to solve this is for the government to bill the airline passengers for the cost of security screening. It wouldn't be much per ticket, maybe $15. And it would be much less at major airports, because the economies of scale are so much greater.<\/p> <p>The article even points out that customers would gladly pay the extra $15 because of another externality: the people who decide whether or not to take the helicopter trip are not the people actually paying for it.<\/p> <blockquote>Bobby Weiss, a self-employed stock trader and real estate broker who was U.S. Helicopter's first paying customer yesterday, said he would pay $300 for a round trip to Kennedy, and he expected most corporate executives would, too. <p>\"It's $300, but so what? It goes on the expense account,\" said Mr. Weiss, adding that he had no qualms about the diversion of federal resources to smooth the path of highfliers. \"Maybe a richer guy may save a little time at the expense of a poorer guy who spends a little more time in line.\"<\/p><\/blockquote> <p>What Mr. Weiss is saying is that the costs -- both the direct cost and the cost of the security checkpoint -- are externalities to him, so he really doesn't care. Exactly.<\/p><\/blockquote><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

That's quite a bit, but such big-budget blockbusters are rare, and you can make and market a Hollywood movie for well under half that figure. Indeed, <i>Brokeback Mountain<\/i> had a <a href=\"http:\/\/boxofficemojo.com\/movies\/?id=brokebackmountain.htm\">production budget of only US$14 million<\/a>.   <\/p><p> In the tech industry, the price of a new fab is currently around US$5 billion, a price that puts such facilities out of reach for all but the biggest players like Intel and IBM. Still, that's 25 <i>King Kong<\/i>s, or over 350 <i>Brokeback Mountain<\/i>s, or 1,000 five million dollar episodes of a big-budget HBO series like <i>Rome<\/i> or <i>The Sopranos<\/i>. My point is that, for even just half the price of a single 65nm fab, the tech industry could buy a few small studios and just start throwing tons of free content at the world. Or, for the full price of a fab, they could fund almost a decade worth of low- and medium-budget content to give away as an inducement for people to buy hardware. <\/p> <p>Intel, IBM, and other tech companies with large investments in Linux know full well that you can sell a lot of hardware by giving away the software. Why not give away the content too? How many dollars worth of media center, home networking, and home network attached storage hardware could you sell if consumers knew that there were terabytes of free, unencumbered, high-definition, processor-intensive, storage-hungry, bandwidth burning, digital content awaiting them on the Internet&#226;content that they could copy, share, and shuffle around among as many newly purchased media devices as they like? <\/p><\/blockquote> <\/p><p>But there is one serious problem with this, content industry may be very small but not the telecom industry, which is 15 times as big acoording to this article. Hollywood is just the vamp, the real villians are telecom companies.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

Let people easily create social applications tailored with difference web services. Allow others to clone those applications and take the code from them directly into whatever they are building instead of building from scratch. Watch everything evolve as better and better stuff gets built, which in turn is used to build even better stuff. Ning leverages the platform by aggregating the applications and selling advertising and premium tools\/features. <\/p><\/blockquote><p>Which is so wrong. In my previous post <a href=\"http:\/\/nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com\/2005\/10\/ning-my-thoughts.html\">about ning<\/a>, I said <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"What good is reusing code if you can not reuse the data?\"<\/span>. Imagine <a href=\"http:\/\/cuteoverload.ning.com\/list.php?sort=winner\">Whats Cuter<\/a>; on their winners page they have listed 50 pages of winners, with each page containing 10 results, which means there already have been atleast 500 contests. This is also ning's most popular application, which means I am thinking probably thousands of users are using it already. <br \/><br \/>Now I read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ning.com\">www.ning.com<\/a> which says step 2 <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"Follow the Clone this App button to clone and customize your app. It's that easy.\"<\/span>, yes it is that easy but if I did it would I get to work with those images that has already been uploaded, those votes that has already been casted? or would I be expecting suddenly those thousands of users will on day one move to my new application and stop using the previous one. When they are saying \"clone\" what they mean is \"fork\", and this is what wikipedia has to say about <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fork_(open_source)\">forking in open source<\/a>: <br \/><blockquote>The term is particularly used in free or open source software, when a schism occurs because of different goals or personality clashes. In a fork of this type, both parties inherit identical intellectual rights but typically only the larger group, or that containing the original architect, will retain the full original name and its associated social capital. Thus there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.<\/blockquote> <\/p><p>So they have made \"try to kill this project that I like so much\" the easiest operation and somehow fooled themselves into thinking it is a good thing. <br \/><br \/>This is the most important thing you should be looking for in the revised ning, if they don't do it this time, they will repeat their previous failure story. <\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

Despite the growing excuses, I believe it  spells out a few interesting bits.   <\/p><blockquote> <p>Americans have forgotten what it takes to remain  free. Instead, every ideology, every group is determined to  use government to advance its agenda. As the government's  power grows, the people are eclipsed.    <\/p><p>We have reached a point where the Bush administration is determined to  totally eclipse the people. Bewitched by neoconservatives and lustful  for power, the Bush administration and the Republican Party are  aligning themselves firmly against the American people. Their first  victims, of course, were the true conservatives. Having eliminated  internal opposition, the Bush administration is now using blackmail  obtained through illegal spying on American citizens to silence the  media and the opposition party.    <\/p><p>[...]   <\/p><p>Before flinching at my assertion of blackmail, ask yourself  why President Bush refuses to obey the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act. The purpose of the FISA court is to ensure  that administrations do not spy for partisan political  reasons. The warrant requirement is to ensure that a panel of  independent federal judges hears a legitimate reason for the  spying, thus protecting a president from the temptation to  abuse the powers of government. <b>The only reason for the  Bush administration to evade the court is that the Bush  administration had no legitimate reasons for its spying. This  should be obvious even to a naif.<\/b> <\/p><p>The years of illegal spying have given the Bush  administration power over the media and the  opposition. Journalists and Democratic politicians don't want  to have their adulterous affairs broadcast over television or  to see their favorite online porn sites revealed in headlines  in the local press with their names attached. <b>Only people  willing to risk such disclosures can stand up for the country.<\/b> <\/p><\/blockquote> <p>(Emphasis added)   <\/p><p>In particular I like his point about the no-fly list.  It  always felt dumb to have the no-fly list in the first place  and all of the side effects we have heard from it are the  result of this dumbness.  Maybe it was naivete on my part, but  this makes sense:   <\/p><blockquote>   Consider the no-fly list. This list has no purpose whatsoever  but to harass and disrupt the livelihoods of Bush's  critics. If a known terrorist were to show up at check-in, he  would be arrested and taken into custody, not told that he  could not fly. What sense does it make to tell someone who is  not subject to arrest and who has cleared screening that he or  she cannot fly? How is this person any more dangerous than any  other passenger?   <\/blockquote> <p>This is priceless:   <\/p><blockquote> <b>If Senator Ted Kennedy, a famous senator with two martyred  brothers, can be put on a no-fly list, as he was for several  weeks, anyone can be put on the list<\/b>. The list has no  accountability. People on the list cannot even find out why  they are on the list. There is no recourse, no procedure for  correcting mistakes.   <p>I am certain that there are more Bush critics on the list  than there are terrorists. According to reports, the <b>list  now comprises 80,000 names! This number must greatly dwarf  the total number of terrorists in the world and certainly the  number of known terrorists.<\/b> <\/p><\/blockquote> <p>He has a follow up article, on the State of The Union,  focusing in particular on the economy bits <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http:\/\/www.counterpunch.org\/roberts02012006.html\">here<\/a>.   <\/p><p>On that note, Bilmes and Stiglitz <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http:\/\/www.commondreams.org\/views06\/0117-20.htm\">claim<\/a>  that the actual cost of the Iraq war will end up being between  one and two trillion dollars.   <\/p><p>In the meantime there is a Sundance short that makes fun at  the actual state of the economy.  I found it entertaining, but  it might not be appreciated by everyone (sorry, requires an  updated Flash): <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http:\/\/festival.sundance.org\/2006\/watch\/film.aspx?which=402&amp;category=DOC\">here<\/a>.   <\/p><p><b>Update: <\/b> Robert's second article goes well with the  previous video link:   <\/p><blockquote> <p>[...] The US trade deficit in ATP now exceeds the US  surplus in Intellectual Property licenses and fees. The US no  longer earns enough from high tech to cover any part of its  import bill for oil, autos, or clothing.  <\/p><\/blockquote> <p>This is an astonishing development. The US \"superpower\" is  dependent on China for advanced technology products and is  dependent on Asia to finance its massive deficits and foreign  wars.

This is the the first two paragraphs:<\/p><blockquote>Google users in China today struggle with a service that, to be blunt, isn't very good. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/\">Google.com<\/a> appears to be down around 10% of the time. Even when users can reach it, the website is slow, and sometimes produces results that when clicked on, stall out the user's browser. Our <a href=\"http:\/\/news.google.com\/\">Google News<\/a> service is never available; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/imghp?hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;q=\">Google Images<\/a> is accessible only half the time. At Google we work hard to create a great experience for our users, and the level of service we've been able to provide in China is not something we're proud of.<br \/><br \/>This problem could only be resolved by creating a local presence, and this week we did so, by launching <a href=\"http:\/\/google.cn\/\">Google.cn<\/a>, our website for the People's Republic of China. In order to do so, we have agreed to remove certain sensitive information from our search results. We know that many people are upset about this decision, and frankly, we understand their point of view. This wasn't an easy choice, but in the end, we believe the course of action we've chosen will prove to be the right one.<\/blockquote><p>Lets look at the fact: Google claims to do it because their services were slow or down for upto 10% of the time. Now its totally easy to understand that Google has such high quality requirements that this is not acceptable, but if they say this is the their only problem, then they should highlight very clearly that Google is such great company that 10% downtime is not acceptable to them. Their next sentence should have been:<\/p><blockquote> This bad quality of service is due to censorship imposed by Chinese Govt. who is trying to limit access to politically sensitive information. Now we understand that about 93.45% of our usage is not about politically significant matter, and is about matters of science and technology, something that we strongly believe citizens of emerging countries like China should have access to. Considering all this, smart brains at Google, that we managed to preserve after an alian spaceship crash at Google Headquarters sometime in 1998, decide the following: we will create a www.google.cn which will conform to China's censorship, but do not worry, as our stats tell us only (100-93.45 = )6.55% of queries results will be affected by this censorship, in return the youths of China will get unabated access to Google archieves and search results. And we also promise, once again, www.google.com search results will be uncensored going with our spirit. Chinese citizens are welcome to use it if they think their query is not suitable for www.google.cn, although the quality will not be as great as we would like to, due to factors beyond our control. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Let me reiterate we are not hiding any information from them, we are just making a smaller subset of inforation more readily available.<\/span><br \/><br \/>Some will say this is a slippery slope, and acceding to one country's demand will force us to do the same for other country, to which all we can say, maybe, but this is one fifth of population we are talking about, and if for their progress we have to dilute the Google brand that we have worked so hard to create, and love so much, its a sacrifice worth making. Atleast we would know we listened to our hearts, and we did our level best.<\/blockquote><p>How could they screw up so bad!<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

The Chinese people aren't idiots, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/news\/2006\/01\/26\/D8FCDB6O0.html\" title=\"breitbart.com\">they know their government censors information<\/a> [breitbart.com], and they would know why Google had suddenly been blocked by the firewall. Word would get out, through the grapevine and other unofficial channels, and it might even constitute an embarrassing loss of face for the Communist party. Of course, the Chinese would much prefer that Baidu, Sino, or one of their own home-grown search engines be the #1 search engine, but they would still know that the only truly reliable search engine, the one that refuses to censor their information, was Google, and had been blocked by their government. Unlike Americans, the Chinese have long memories, and such an association would pay off in PR and face for Google in the long term.<br \/><br \/>Google on the other hand might take a stock price hit, but no investor could say they were't warned that Google might make decisions based on long-term considerations rather than short term stock-price-propping, or that Google's corporate values might sometimes conflict with the best interests of their stock price. However, such a move would certainly solidify the image of Google as a singular organization with the most honest and accurate search results worldwide, truly dedicated to its mission of organizing <em>all<\/em> the world's information.<br \/><br \/>Furthermore, Google's refusal to cooperate with the Chinese Government might have opened the door for other search engines, media, and businesses to follow suit, and emboldened the Chinese people and businesses to demand more unfettered access to information and less government interference. Someone mentioned on<nobr> <wbr><\/wbr><\/nobr>\/. in a comment on one of the other articles about Google's recent decision that one problem that international businesses, particularly media, face in dealing with China is that they all deal individually with the Chinese government, and hence have little to no leverage. The Chinese government needs multinationals right now as much as, or more than, multinationals need China, but China needs them in aggregate rather than individually, so can take a divide-and-conquer approach at regulating them. What is needed is an industry organization, formal or informal, dedicated to upholding freedom of the press, to which all media companies operating in China can belong, a support network that mutually resists the pressure by the Chinese government on any one company to censor information. Google refusing to censor its results could have been a step in that direction, and if any company has the clout to the lead the formation of such an organization, it's Google.<br \/><br \/>So this appears to be an unfortunately wasted opportunity, for Google to make a strong political statement based on its values, that might have hurt it in the short term but most likely have paid off in PR and face in the long-term.<br \/><br \/>Google, we expected better.<div class=\"sig\">--<br \/>All that is human must retrograde if it do not advance.<\/div><\/div><\/blockquote><div class=\"commentBody\"><div class=\"sig\"><\/div> <\/div><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

To log in a user you can set <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">request.session[users.SESSION_KEY]<\/span> to <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">user_id<\/span> of the user. To logout, delete <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">users.SESSION_KEY<\/span> from <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">request.session<\/span>. They should mention this in their documentation.<\/li><li>If you find <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/authentication\/#the-login-required-decorator\">login_required<\/a> decorator enough for your needs, but do not like the \/accounts\/login\/ url, you can edit django\/views\/auth\/login.py and set them what you want. They should make it configurable through setting.py<\/li><li><span style=\"font-family: courier new;\">login_required<\/span> is convenient but <span style=\"font-family: courier new;\">django.views.auth.login<\/span> lacking , if you modify the \"\/accounts\/login\/\" line as discussed above, to some of your view own you can avoid <span style=\"font-family: courier new;\">django.views.auth.login<\/span> views.<br \/><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/weblog\/2005\/sep\/24\/newshortcuts\/\">render_to_response documentation<\/a>, well actually this is just a blog post entry and not supposed to be updated as and when required, and they don't mention what is it in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/tutorial4\/\">tutorial<\/a> when they are using it, nor in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/templates_python\/\">right place where they should<\/a>. Anyways, when using render_to_response I could not find how to user <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/templates_python\/#subclassing-context-djangocontext\">DjangoContext<\/a>, and giving up such nice shortcut just because of this was a bit sad. Well it so happens that it is supported, use something like <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">render_to_response('template', context_instance=DjangoContext(request))<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">get_absolute_url<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/model_api\/#model-methods\">model method<\/a>: well the only documented use of this method is in the admin UI, but admin prefers to ignore it, and uses some redirects instead. Well actually they do not ignore it, and redirect takes you to the right place, but for that to work you will have put <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">(r'^r\/', include('django.conf.urls.shortcut')),<\/span> in your URLConf. Not documented.<br \/><\/li><li>But this may not solve all your problems with admin site taking you to the right place when you click on \"<span class=\"q\">View on Site\" in admin. You will have to make sure the sites model contains the right site, which includes the domain name and port number, but without http:\/\/ part. Not documented.<br \/><\/span><\/li><li><span class=\"q\">One of the first thing that comes to your mind when you read django's authentication framework, is wow its cool, but what if I need more fields than they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/authentication\/#fields\">support<\/a>? Well given I just leared the super cool <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/model_api\/\">model framework<\/a>, I am tempted to create a model and define a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/model_api\/#one-to-one-relationships\">one-to-one relationship<\/a> on it with User. Well bad idea. For some reason this won't work, and the preferred way to do such extensions is <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/models\/subclassing\/\">Subclassing models<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><p>Best django tip other than \"use django, it is cool\" would be: join mailing lists, esp <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/django-developers\">django-developers<\/a>, people are very friendly there, and you get prompt help.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

By agressive I mean I have a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">logging.info(\"entering function foo, with arguments \"blah\" of type &lt;str&gt;\")<\/span> and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">logging.info(\"exiting function foo with return value ..\")<\/span> at beginning and each end point of most functions I write. Obviously this is going to become tedious, and python decorator are the best thing to do such, but they make the logging extreamly verbose. A good log viewer might be of help for filtering this log is a must. Just came across <a href=\"http:\/\/codespeak.net\/py\/current\/doc\/test.html#debug-with-the-print-statement\">debug with print statement<\/a> section of py.test, and that could be a great idea, since logging is very verbose, do not print anything, but when an \"interesting event\" occurs, print all logs generated in that function call. Which beings us to what is an interesting event? One obvious candidate is exceptions, we all know they are bad, but we can borrow ideas from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ilowe.net\/software\/typecheck\/\">typecheck<\/a>, and define a failure by typecheck as another interesting event. [Though typecheck has no provision for acceptable exceptions, a support for typecheck.exceptions() would be good too.]<\/p><p>This can in one go give all all the advantage of strict typed languages, but unlike them, we do not force anything to you, just report when things go out of \"normal\". This can make programming python even more fun. The reason typecheck should be coupled with logging decorator is because it can become tedious to use too many decorators otherwise.<\/p><p>self.todo++<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

I have some 800 photos on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/upadhyay\/\">my Flickr<\/a> account, and most of them remind me some memories, and this is the reason I use badge. It also presents my visitors some glimpses from my life that I conisdered not too private. The decision to switch was governed by the fact that I will be able to view more than 4-5 random pictures. I guess the desigers of Flick badge are aware of this use case and something is drastically wrong with them if they are not, and anyone without much thought can arrive at the conclusion that if that is the requirement, the selection of images should be decently randomized, so other than animating some images, they had just one requirement, and yet after getting millions of dollars from Yahoo!, they decided its okay for them not to meet even that. I mean how hard it is not to realize that they are picking pictures from only my latest 10-20% or so with maximum waitage on the latest ones, and this only happens in their Flash badge, HTML badge was quite random.  <\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

On each request, the PHP script is looked up, parsed, and executed, and parsing is a major overhead if the size of script is significant. The problem is none of the tutorials or documentation I have read talk about this significant fact, maybe they just assume that everyone knows about it, or consider it as a part of PHP standard installtion. The performace boost is very significant, upto 400% in my installtion\/application, and eAccelerator or any other script caching should be considered for all PHP installtions.  <\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

The evidence that she actually did kill that kid were recovered much later, but the mob had pronounced their judgment and carried the executed much already. Somehow a group of people will just decide what should happen in the name of morals or ethics or anything they feel like, and do anything, burn valentine's day card shops, movie theaters, attack people personally, and their family or anyone they can get their hands on.

Click on the leftmost tab, and click across the tabs until you reach the end. That it. It's either there or it's not--there are no other \"rocks\" to look under, no other places we've hidden functionality. We've found in early tests that people find it easier to discover how to do new things in the Ribbon, and they're more apt to explore the UI looking for better ways to get things done. <p>The Ribbon supports 2D layout of controls, meaning that the kind of command presentation can look sometimes like a toolbar, sometimes like a menu, but other times more like a dialog box, Task Pane, or even a web page. The Ribbon gives us, as UI designers, a great deal more flexibility to communicate in our design things like relative relationships between different features. Key functionality can have large buttons, while supporting functions have smaller, grouped controls. As you can see in the pictures below, there are a lot of different layouts possible.<\/p> <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sunflowerhead.com\/msimages\/DifferentLayouts-9-14-2005.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.sunflowerhead.com\/msimages\/DifferentLayouts-9-14-2005_thumb.png\" \/><\/a> <em><br \/>(click to enlarge)<\/em><\/p> <p> <\/p><p>Something we've known from usability tests for several years now is that most people don't click on an unlabeled 16x16 icon. Sure, Bold and Italic and Center and a few others get a lot of clicks, but the curve falls off after the first 8 or so. As a result, we try to label every command in the Ribbon. We are also upgrading the overall iconography of the product (something that's not reflected in the screenshots you're seeing), but even a big, beautiful icon can't help you find a command as well as that icon + the word \"Margins.\"<\/p> <p>Each Ribbon \"tab\" contains a set of \"chunks.\" (You can tell marketing hasn't spiffed up our codenames yet!) A chunk is a set of related commands within a tab. Not only does this help group commands to make them easier to scan, but it allows us to not have to repeat the same words over and over in the command names. For instance, in a \"Border\" chunk, we can have Color, Weight, and Style commands without having to repeat \"Border\" in front of each of them.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Trying to \"cotentextualize\" is a difficult task, guessing what user want to do based on what how they interact the UI <a href=\"http:\/\/news.com.com\/2100-1001-255671.html?legacy=cnet\">has been tried before without much success<\/a>, but it adds to UI elements at the disposal of UI designers to experiment with, toolbars are in adequate, menus are typicaly difficult to navigate, a free flowing widget if done right can overcome most of their limitations.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

FAQ<\/a>:<br \/><blockquote><h3>Slashdot should cache pages to prevent the Slashdot Effect!<\/h3> <p>Sure, it's a great idea, but it has a lot of implications. For example, commercial sites rely on their banner ads to generate revenue. If I cache one of their pages, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">this will mess with their statistics, and mess with their banner ads. In other words, this will piss them off.<\/span><\/p> <p>Of course, most of the time, the commercial sites that actually have income from banner ads easily withstand the Slashdot Effect. So perhaps we could draw the line at sites that don't have ads. They are, after all, much more likely to buckle under the pressure of all those unexpected hits. But what happens if I cache the site, and they update themselves? Once again, I'm transmitting data that I shouldn't be, only this time my cache is out of date!<\/p> <p>I could try asking permission, but do you want to wait 6 hours for a cool breaking story while we wait for permission to link someone?<\/p> <p>So the quick answer is: \"Sure, caching would be neat.\" It would make things a lot easier when servers go down, but it's a complicated issue that would need to be thought through in great detail before being implemented.<\/p> <p><em><small>                 Answered by: <a href=\"mailto:malda@slashdot.org\">CmdrTaco<\/a><br \/>              Last Modified: 6\/14\/00         <\/small><\/em><\/p> <h3>Is it possible to have META tags that Slashdot looks for in a story link before allowing it to be submitted\/posted? Many times a server can't handle the load of a Slashdotting. So can the site have tags to prevent it from being added to a Slashdot story?<\/h3> <p>Not inconceivable, but I don't really think it's worth the work. Most of the sites that are Slashdotted are prepared for it, and the sites that get smashed usually are caught completely off guard; they wouldn't know of this mysterious opt-out meta tag.

Some unsuspecting sysadmin suffers too in the process. Caching pages is the solution and if the reason why they don't do it is: \"this will mess with their statistics, and mess with their banner ads.

Today I came across this <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0112098\/2005\/11\/16.html#a541\">post<\/a>:<br \/><blockquote>The Java eco system has zillions of web frameworks from JSF, Tapestry, Struts, WebWork, Spring WebFlow to things like JSP\/JSTL\/Velocity etc. There's probably a new web framework born every day in Java some place.<br \/><br \/>However if the world really does go Ajax or some kinda client technology very Ajax like - will that cause these traditional HTML\/HTTP web frameworks to become legacy?<br \/><br \/>Web frameworks spend most of their time doing things like, dealing with HTTP and HTML, maintaining client side state on the server - handing intermediate form submissions & validation, templating\/rendering issues and binding business objects to HTML form controls etc.<br \/><br \/>These days Ajax has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trimpath.com\/project\/wiki\/JavaScriptTemplates\">template engines<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/goog-ajaxslt\/\">XPath\/XSLT engines<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themidnightcoders.com\/\">SOAP stacks<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.formfaces.com\/\">XForms implementations <\/a>and so forth all done on the client side. You can  do <a href=\"http:\/\/bennolan.com\/behaviour\/\">clever things<\/a> like hide the JavaScript from your HTML page and use CSS to bind the JavaScript to the markup.<br \/><br \/>There's even a <a href=\"http:\/\/trimpath.com\/project\/wiki\/TrimJunction\">JavaScript version<\/a> of Ruby on Rails that runs in the browser! :)<br \/><br \/>So is the web application of the future going to be static HTML &amp; JavaScript, served up by Apache with Ajax interacting with a bunch of XML based web services (maybe using SOAP, maybe just REST etc)? If so, do we really need a web framework thats focussed on HTTP and HTML, or are we just gonna end up developing a bunch of XML based web services and letting Ajax do all the templating, editing and viewing?<br \/><br \/>Is this the end of web frameworks as we know it?<\/blockquote><\/p><p>Makes some pretty interesting point, <a href=\"http:\/\/argv0.net\/static\/mochitut\/1\/\">here is an example<\/a> of how a complete web application, resides in a:<\/p><blockquote><pre><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>html<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">&gt;<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>head<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">&gt;<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#a020f0\"> <\/font><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>script<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\"> <\/font><font color=\"#2e8b57\"><b>src<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">=<\/font><font color=\"#ff00ff\">&quot;index.js&quot;<\/font><font color=\"#008080\">\/&gt;<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;\/<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>head<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">&gt;<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>body<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">&gt;<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>div<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\"> <\/font><font color=\"#2e8b57\"><b>id<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">=<\/font><font color=\"#ff00ff\">&quot;enclose&quot;<\/font><font color=\"#008080\">\/&gt;<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;\/<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>body<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">&gt;<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#008080\">&lt;\/<\/font><font color=\"#804040\"><b>html<\/b><\/font><font color=\"#008080\">&gt;<\/font><\/pre><\/blockquote><p>If this is the future, we shold rename HTTP to JSTP I guess :-) Unfortunate thing is javascript is a crappy language to develop large applications.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

Some people asked who I would consider credible.<\/p> <p>Let me point out, by way of background, that all of the intelligence agencies of every major country believed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. That was based on lots of data that all pointed in the same direction. It's probably safe to say that those agencies had a preconcieved notion that Saddam had WMD, and so they saw all of the data as consistent with that view.<\/p> <p>Further, let me point out that there are 17,000 mutual funds being managed by highly qualified financial experts. They'll tell you that investing in a managed mutual fund is a better idea than buying an index fund. But on average, managed funds underperform the indexes, and you would have no way of knowing which ones won't. Each of those financial experts has a financial incentive to mislead you about the odds.<\/p> <p>I would consider credible anyone who didn't have a preconcieved notion or a financial\/career incentive. When you're talking about the cause of life itself, I submit that no one can pass that test (especially people who write books on the topic).

If I could record the taps on my helmet, I could surely use those for percussion in any kind of classical or rock number. I&#226;ll never know how many dragonflies reached the other side after hitting us. After 9 hrs of drive, interrupted by tea and snack breaks, we reached <a href=\"http:\/\/www.world66.com\/asia\/southasia\/india\/karnataka\/hampi\">Hampi<\/a> market. It was 3 in a pleasant afternoon. Hampi is a small laidback place, a bit crowded at this time of the year owing to Dussera festivities.<br \/><br \/>The past is so pronounced that only a dork will be unable to imagine how the city must&#226;ve been 800 years ago. Temples, as always, are history etched in stone. They paint a comprehensive picture of contemporary art, science, commerce, society, and everything under the medieval sun.<a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/1933\/592\/1600\/IMG_2812.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/1933\/592\/320\/IMG_2812.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a> So what does this pillar, with a statue of a man playing the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">damroo<\/span> in front and thin columns on its sides, tell us? Not just about the musical inclination of the people. It so happens that striking those columns with knuckles (or wooden sticks) produces the sound of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">damroo<\/span>. Other pillars have statues of artists with <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">mridanga<\/span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">dhol<\/span>, and other classical musical instruments and striking the columns produces the sounds of corresponding instruments. Look at the column at the right side of this statue, and one in the background. The former is octagonal, the latter is fluted. Each has a distinct diameter, a unique shape, and a different tension owing to the weight of the stone structure placed at the top; and probably other features that help producing different sounds. All of these columns are made of solid stone though. There were also columns that were as sonorous as the brass bells used in Hindu temples. And then there is a pillar with eight columns, each of which produces a note in the octave. Inscriptions have it that there were about 56 such pillars. When played, the sound of music travelled as far as a kilometer.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>I envy you Namit :-)<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

            "content": "<p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ning.com\/\">Ning<\/a> is a stealth mode startup, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webaroo.com\/\">that little one<\/a> that is going to change the world, launched today, by Marc Andressen, the Netscape fame, and many other smart brains as <a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/2005\/10\/04\/ning-the-real-24-hour-laundry\/\">Om says<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>First of all there is no Web 2.0-ness about it that we have come to associate with GMail and all those AJAX websites, its very web 1.0, plain old PHP programs fetching data, wrapping HTML around them and producing usual applications, what it has achieved is:<br \/><ul><li>sharing the authentication, one login works against all ning applications, same users in the comments etc.<br \/><\/li><li>sharing data, atleast at meta level, something they call <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ning.com\/pivot\">pivot<\/a>, you can see the latest bookmarks as well as latest photo uploaded on the same page. You may not care about that, if its for the world, but you go one level deeper and you have all bookmarks, restraunt\/movie\/book review and photos uploaded by a user, and that may be a good thing.<\/li><li>sharing the code, you like an application and want to change it in a way that suits you or your locality\/company\/group? You can do it in as few as a couple of clicks, once you have beta account, which I still don't :-(<br \/><\/li><\/ul>Sharing. Sharing. Sharing. And we all know sharing is good. :-)<br \/><br \/>If you are developing an application, you won't have to worry about user registrations, about writing code for tagging, which somehow is so cool these days, you won't have to worry about data repository, they have done it all for you, all you do is define what data[object] you are going to store, and for each object, how it \"looks\", how you change its state, and be done with it, everything else taken care of by ning. So far so good.<br \/><br \/>So what have they done wrong, or rather terrible, which drastically reduces its impact: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">they have associated data with applications<\/span>. A very bad idea, data belongs to users, its social software. What good is reusing code if you can not reuse the data? This would lead to artificial segregation of: users, a very valuable commodity to, well any social software. Would you care if someone creates a flickr2 if you can not see your photos already there with lets say the improved UI that flickr2 promised? Would you download your 600 photos and upload it again to flickr2? And would you do the same when flickr3 comes around? The whole sharing idea goes into drain.<br \/><br \/>Users, and then user data is the most important thing in social software, whereas ning decided its users, followed by code!<br \/><br \/>If I had my way I would add an option of \"view schema\" along with \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ning.com\/about-view-source.html\">view source<\/a>\" and \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ning.com\/about-cloning.html\">clone application<\/a>\". Indentify schema's by GUIDs instead of names would solve the schema namespace problem. What is schema namespace problem? something I defined, let me explain: lets say all those applications work on types of objects, restraunt review application has objects restraunt and object review, reviews or restraunts can be added or deleted, they have to be displayed etc. Now review is a common word and a lot of applications will have review like object, a review of a movie for example is also a review. If data is not associated with applications, it would be difficult to say if an object of type review is actually a restraunt review or a movie review and we would have to call them RestrauntReview and MovieReview. But MovieReview name may conflict with Flash MovieReview which some \"rate your favourite flash movie\" application may have used. This is what I call schema namespace problem that would suddenly become a big issue if data is not associated with applications but are global. Solution for this problem is calling each object with GUIDs and not names, and using local aliases for GUIDs to object. GUIDs are gobally unique names, so there is no clash, but they are cumbersome to use, difficult to remember, so each application can define alises for the schemas.<br \/><br \/>Now if things were like this, and I had to clone a superhit flickr like application hosted on ning, I would go to \"view schema\" for that application, get the GUID and the schema detail for all data types defined or used by this application, then either clone the application if I am interested in reusing their source or write one from scratch but using the same schema GUIDs. Now schema is fixed at the time of definition so I can not corrupt the data stored for someother application, and photos uploaded to my new shiney flickr2 would be accessible via both new and old applications.<br \/><br \/>So far so good again, but there is a very strong criticism against this idea: the old application might have done lots of validation of the data and made specific assumption about it to work reliably, and this may break the old application, what if the new application applies a \"smart\" url rewriting and rewrites all urls in all the objects and due to a bug in it, even the old applications stops working?<br \/><br \/>Make data readonly from other application? It makes importing data easier, but data is still not shared.<br \/><br \/>Data changeable only via user actions? Thats easy to implement, ning knows who data belongs to and who is the currently logged in user. Would it help? Its akin to user filesystem available to all applications, and only applications that know what they are doing, and thus are sure would not corrupt userdata, would touch that data, and users will touch only the applications that they trust. Though this brings the scary picture of ming viruses and worms, there are many things that makes it not as bad. For example, each ning application may have a review section where users can read other users opinion about it, and some stats for each application like how often it has been used. Also ning can do something more: it knows what all applications are accessing shared data and all application administrator can evaluate each application they are sharing data with and blocklist them, data still belongs to users, but users will get this blocklist warning and may refuse to use them. Also ning may then offer them to create hidden profiles so that they can keep two seperate sets of data with same schema that each application may use. This could work. <\/p><p>Ning, are you listening?<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

Yes they include a lot of dependecies, and yes its not the most optimal utilization of libraries, but the convenience it offers is well worth it. The fact that the builders can decide what should be distributed and which libraries are to be assumed to be available on the base system, its not that inefficient either. Another good thing about it is its distribution neutral, so it works well with Debian as well as for SUSE or Linspire.

Yet another thing out of my ToDo list, looks like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theoldmonk.net\/blog\/\">Gera<\/a>'s advise is working good for me :-).<\/p> <p>SOPA implementation is derived[copied] heavily from Server.py from SOAPpy distribution, so API's are the same as well as every configuration setting is done as usual with SOAPpy's Config class. Though it works, I do not like it, for the simple reason that NO SOAP server\/client implementation should bypass WSDL for compatibility's sake, which our beloved Microsoft has made the biggest problem in SOAP world. Whats really annoying is PHP's <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/package\/SOAP\">SOAP implementation<\/a> by PEAR supports WSDL by server but SOPApy <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/mailarchive\/message.php?msg_id=12720353\">does not<\/a>, [tho the <a href=\"http:\/\/cvs.sourceforge.net\/viewcvs.py\/pywebsvcs\/SOAPpy\/README?rev=HEAD\">REDAME<\/a> hints on the contrary]. Obviously type reason as mentioned by Charles Moad doesn't hold as 1) PHP beaing a weakly typed language can support it so why can't python which is strongly typed 2) SOAP implementation has to know about the type or else it can not convert them to SOAP packets, now if they know why can't they varify it against some WSDL? Trying to generate WSDL programmatically is evil, you go in that direction and the first thing you find is WSDL's generated by Visual Studio and your soul cringes trying to make everything compatible with them, bad bad bad. <a href=\"http:\/\/manuals.rubyonrails.com\/read\/chapter\/68\">Ruby does it<\/a>, but I won't like to see it in python world.<\/p> <p>Ofcourse all this has little to do with django per se, its just the state of affairs with SOAP and python right now, as far as I can see. Assuming SOAPpy is good, SOAP support for django, available <a href=\"http:\/\/nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com\/soap.txt\">here<\/a> for now, <a href=\"http:\/\/code.djangoproject.com\/ticket\/552\">ticket for adding it to django is pending<\/a>, is acceptable. Its implemented as a callable view object, and implements the <a href=\"http:\/\/pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net\/apidocs\/SOAPpy\/Server.html#SOAPServerBase\">SOAPServerBase<\/a> for registering functions and instances.

You can use our <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/slashcode\">sourceforge project page<\/a> to submit bugs and we'd really appreciate the feedback. Thanks to Tim Vroom for putting the HTML in place, Wes Moran for writing the HTML in the first place, and Pudge for writing the code to convert 900k users, 60k stories, and 13 million comments to comply. And for the brave, download the stylesheet and start experimenting with new themes and designs for Slashdot: some sort of official contest to re-design Slashdot is coming soon, so you can get a head start now. <\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <div class=\"storylinks\"> <div>  (  <ul><li class=\"more\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/article.pl?sid=05\/09\/22\/1324207&amp;tid=124\"><b>Read More...<\/b><\/a> <\/li><li> <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/article.pl?sid=05\/09\/22\/1324207&amp;mode=nocomment&amp;tid=124\">1100 bytes in body<\/a> <\/li><li class=\"comments\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/article.pl?sid=05\/09\/22\/1324207&amp;threshold=3&amp;tid=124\">113<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/article.pl?sid=05\/09\/22\/1324207&amp;threshold=-1&amp;tid=124\">701<\/a> comments  <\/li><\/ul>  )  <\/div><\/div> <\/blockquote> <\/p><p>While it used to look like <a href=\"http:\/\/nerdierthanthou.nfshost.com\/2004\/11\/yesterday-on-slashdot.html\">this<\/a> previously. <\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

When a person handed you a business card in 1991 the odds were pretty high that you'd have your choice from a legion of email addresses. There would be the ubiquitous CompuServe UID, a BIX id, maybe a GEnie address, FidoNet perhaps, Delphi, and Bob help you -- sometimes even a Prodigy account (the precursor to geocities if there ever was one).<br \/><br \/>People ended up having to establish presence on each of these separate networks. All the systems had their own unique quirks and limitations and the situation was a total mess. Human handshaking became a negotiation nearly as complicated as the modem protocols that hardware used.<br \/><br \/><table border=\"0\"> <tbody><tr><td><img src=\"http:\/\/colo.slacker.com\/postpics\/mailicon.jpg\" style=\"border: 0px none ;\" height=\"128\" width=\"125\" \/><\/td> <td><i>\"Yeah, so mainly I use GEnie\"<br \/>\"Erg, I'm not on GEnie any more.  I stick mostly to BiX\"<br \/>\"BiX?  Yuck.  Are you on CompuServe?\"<br \/>\"Are you nuts? I just got a 2400 baud modem. Have you seen what they charge an hour for prime time 2400 baud access? How about Fido?\"<br \/>\"Yeah I'm on 1:231\/250.\"<br \/>\"Cool\"<\/i><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody> <\/table><br \/>...and so the dance went any time you needed to email a new person.<br \/><br \/>Eventually the major service providers began establishing complicated gateways between the systems, but I'm not convinced that these hacks and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.faqs.org\/faqs\/mail\/inter-network-guide\/\">their ad hoc and confusing demands<\/a> represented an improvement. At best it worked but usually it just left you wondering if your mail really made it through. It was a solid win if your mail just made it to the right person on the same day and all in one piece.<br \/><br \/>In a short amount of time, coincident with the sudden wave of TCP\/IP adoption in consumer operating systems, the SMTP email protocol began to take hold as the most effective common ground. Each enclave network began to add SMTP gateways for linking to the rest of the world. In what seemed almost overnight at the time, suddenly everyone was talking SMTP natively, Just Like That. Everyone could email everyone else and life was good.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>Nice example of importance of open standards.<\/p><p>On a lesser serious note:<\/p><center><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/upadhyay\/38552966\/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http:\/\/photos25.flickr.com\/38552966_5630a5973c_o.png\" alt=\"google-talk-ads\" style=\"border: 0px none ;\" align=\"middle\" height=\"483\" width=\"350\" \/><\/a><\/center><p>Via <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.outer-court.com\/archive\/2005-08-30.html#n63\">Google Blogscoped<\/a>.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

It doesn't matter how strong or weak the DRM is on the copy that I choose <em>not to buy<\/em> -- all that matters is how much resource one cracker, somewhere in the world, was willing to devote to breaking the DRM.

One of our key findings thus far is this: In many controversial areas (eg, affirmative action, campaign finance, sex discrimination, disability discrimination, environmental regulation, and more), Republican appointees show especially conservative voting patterns when they're sitting on 3-judge panels that consist only of Republican appointees. So too for Democratic appointees: They're far more liberal, in their voting patterns, when sitting with two fellow Democratic appointees, than when sitting on a panel with at least one Republican appointee. In other words, Republican appointees look more conservative when they sit only with fellow Republican appointees, and Democratic appointees look more liberal when they sit only with fellow Democratic appointees.<\/p> <p>This is real-world evidence, we think, of group polarization: the process by which like-minded people, engaged in deliberation with one another, typically end up thinking a more extreme version of what they thought before they started to talk. (So, for example, French people who distrust the US distrust the US even more after talking with one another.) Group polarization reflects a form of information aggregation, or at least opinion aggregation, that sometimes leads in unfortunate directions. It's a big contrast to the price system, Wikipedia, and open source software. <\/p> <p>Here's a related phenomenon: hidden profiles. In a deliberating group, shared information (information held by many or most) usually has a much bigger effect than unshared information (information held by a few or just one). The result is that groups have \"hidden profiles,\" in the form of information that doesn't get out, or that has less impact than it deserves. Some big mistakes by private and public organizations (including faculties!) are a result of hidden profiles. <\/p> <\/blockquote><\/p><p>Interesting.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

Sewri is an area on the eastern waterfront of Mumbai and is home to thousands of wintering birds including flamingoes and shorebirds, which are so numerous as to form clouds over the water, wheeling and turning around.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 102);\"> The bridge is supposed to start off from the Sewri side and will cut right through the bay, ultimately destroying the habitat of these birds. For the last few weeks, a bunch of birdwatchers including myself have begun a campaign to save this site and to demand a re-alignment of the proposed bridge.

The transmitter then silently summons the police - and it is ruining the economics of auto theft.... <p>The thief's challenge is that it's impossible to determine which vehicle has a LoJack (there's no decal). So stealing any car becomes significantly more risky, and one academic study found that the introduction of LoJack in Boston reduced car theft there by 50 percent.<\/p> <p>Two Yale professors, Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres, note that this means that the LoJack benefits everyone, not only those who install the system. Professor Ayres and another scholar, Steven Levitt, found that every $1 invested in LoJack saves other car owners $10.<\/p> <p>Professors Nalebuff and Ayres note that other antitheft devices, such as the Club, a polelike device that locks the steering wheel, help protect that car, but only at the expense of the next vehicle.<\/p> <p>\"The Club doesn't reduce crime,\" Mr. Nalebuff says. \"It just shifts it to the next person.\"<\/p><\/blockquote> <p>This model could be applied to home burglar alarms:<\/p> <blockquote>Conventional home alarms are accompanied by warning signs and don't reduce crime but simply shift the risk to the next house. What if we encouraged hidden silent alarms to change the economics of burglary? <p>Granted, most people don't want hidden alarms that entice a burglar to stay until the police show up. But suppose communities adjusted the fees they charge for alarm systems - say, $2,000 a year for an audible alarm, but no charge for a hidden LoJack-style silent alarm.<\/p> <p>Then many people would choose the silent alarms, more burglars would get caught, and many of the criminally inclined would choose a new line of work....<\/p><\/blockquote> <p>I wrote about this in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.schneier.com\/bf.html\" target=\"_top\" class=\"blines2\" title=\"Link to another page in this blog\"><i>Beyond Fear<\/i><\/a>:<\/p> <blockquote>A burglar who sees evidence of an alarm system is more likely to go rob the house next door. As far as the local police station is concerned, this doesn't mitigate the risk at all. But for the homeowner, it mitigates the risk just fine.<\/blockquote> <br \/><p>The difference is the perspective of the defender.<\/p> <p>Problems with perspectives show up in counterterrorism defenses all the time. Also from <i>Beyond Fear<\/i>:<\/p> <blockquote>It's important not to lose sight of the forest for the trees. Countermeasures often focus on preventing particular terrorist acts against specific targets, but the scope of the assets that need to be protected encompasses all potential targets, and they all must be considered together. A terrorist's real target is morale, and he really doesn't care about one physical target versus another. We want to prevent terrorist acts <i>everywhere<\/i>, so countermeasures that simply move the threat around are of limited value. If, for example, we spend a lot of money defending our shopping malls, and bombings subsequently occur in crowded sports stadiums or movie theaters, we haven't really received any value from our countermeasures. <\/blockquote> <br \/>I like seeing thinking like this in the media, and wish there were more of it.<\/blockquote> <br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

However, if I send bit 'a' first, and others want 'b', they have to wait.<br \/><br \/>Now, instead of transmitting to FOO bit 'a' then bit 'b', I send to FOO ('a' XOR 'b') first, then either bit 'a' or bit 'b'. I'll end up sending FOO the same amount of information (assuming the order is specified in the protocol itself).<br \/><br \/>BUT, and here's the cool part. If someone already has 'a', they can get ('a' XOR 'b') from you, and complete their set of data (bits 'a' and 'b'). Furthermore, if someone already has 'b', they also get ('a' XOR 'b') from you, and complete their set. So, by only downloading 1 bit, instead of 2, you can complete the set for others who already have one or the other bits.<br \/><br \/>Now, in practice it'll get a lot more complicated, and the method presented in the paper is not exactly like I describe, but the idea is that you can send data to help people complete their data sets, even though you yourself do not yet have the actual uncomputed data. Instead, you have a computed function of the data, which others can use immediately, and from which you can reconstruct the actual data later when you have more information.<br \/><br \/>The practical upshot is that the computed data is more valuable to other peers than the uncomputed data, as they may be able to use it to complete their data set, rather than wait for the remainder of the uncomputed data.<br \/><br \/>So, in reference to your comments, it may not be so much more practical to any one receiver; they still need to wait for all the data, in either computed or uncomputed form. But, for the network as a whole, it means that each receiver has many more options from which to download and compute each chunk, and thus make available to others. It is not hard to imagine that this can benefit the overall throughput of the network (which the authors of the paper claim).<\/blockquote><br \/>Sounds promising. <br \/><br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

Based on the discussions in Flickr Central, here is one attempt to summarize what members think and value most. Since many hold similar views I have not attempted to credit anyone in particular. I have also tried to read between the lines, therefore all errors and omissions are my own. Please feel free to correct, comment, add or subtract from this.<br \/><br \/><b>The Business<\/b><br \/><br \/>1. Flickr a great and interesting idea.<br \/>2. Most functionality is free.<br \/>3. The pricing structure is simple. What you pay for is clearly defined and easy to understand.<br \/>4. The implementation is great.<br \/>5. Execution is a miracle.<br \/>6. Great things are expected to happen yet.<br \/><br \/><b>Management<\/b><br \/><br \/>7. Is unusually receptive and interested in member&#8217;s wishes.<br \/>8. Freely and informally participates in debates.<br \/>9. Consults the membership on most major initiatives and actively requests input from members.<br \/>10. Is not afraid of change.<br \/>11. They are not judgmental.<br \/>12. Treats the user base as partners, ask their input on software improvement and business issues, and responds quickly to bugs. This leads to the quick identification and fixing of problems.<br \/><br \/><b>Functionality<\/b><br \/><br \/>13. The site and tools are easy to use.<br \/>14. Flickr has more uses than is initially apparent.  As a result, members are happy.<br \/>15. Members have control over their images &#8211; who can see, comment on, and download them.<br \/>16. You can select favorites, place comments, add contacts, write notes, and view slideshows.<br \/>17. Tagging is intuitive and remarkably successful even though no standards exist.<br \/>18. The ability to form groups and to communicate via forums is highly treasured.<br \/>19. Large file sizes are allowed.<br \/>20. Images are automatically resized.<br \/>21. Users can choose to display their EXIF data.<br \/>22. Creative Commons licensing is available and much appreciated.<br \/>23. Your photos are hosted for free, and you can use RSS feeds, and display your photos on your blog.<br \/>24. There&#8217;s an open API that makes the technical gurus spill tears of joy.<br \/><br \/><b>Operational Issues<\/b><br \/><br \/>25. Flickr is focused and is not trying to be everything for everyone. The mail system is minimalist, but this is an advantage since it can only be used inside Flickr and does not distract from the activities.<br \/>26. The system is evolutionary &#8211; that is why it&#8217;s always in Beta. Good!!<br \/>27. Members are the beta-testers.  They are being treated as if they're a valuable resource, and they appreciate it.<br \/>28. New functionality is released rapidly and often, and member input on releases is asked for and valued.<br \/>29. Good ideas from users are actively invited, recognized and implemented where possible.<br \/>30. The tagging system works because of the redundancy. Even though not all photos are tagged correctly, enough results show up to make this method very effective.<br \/>31. The system breaks often, but this is good because it is an indication of rapid growth.  It is expected to improve soon.<br \/><br \/><b>The Flickr Environment<\/b><br \/><br \/>32. The site is well designed.<br \/>33. It is rich and unstructured. Members supply the content and the structure.<br \/>34. Advertising is at a minimum.<br \/>35. It is great for individual purposes like saving and storage.<br \/>36. The site has great community tools for sharing ideas and photos.<br \/>37. The forums often contain quality discussions.<br \/>38. It is very accessible.<br \/>39. The content is diverse and intriguing, but always visually attractive.<br \/>40. Regulation is at a minimum, and a large part of that is left to the members themselves to administer.<br \/>41. The result: Flickr is full of nice surprises.<br \/><br \/><b>The Social Aspect<\/b><br \/><br \/>42. Flickr is open. Anyone can participate.<br \/>43. It&#8217;s has the feel of a flea market or a bazaar.<br \/>44. The place is humming with activity and there is plenty opportunity to meet others.<br \/>45. It is self-organizing. Members can start their own groups, invite others and manage their groups.<br \/>46. No hierarchy here. Flickr is self categorizing. Tagging images helps you organize your collection and makes it easier for others to find. Members and friends can add to your tags which add value to your work.<br \/>47. Tags also bring people together and channel their creativity.<br \/>48. Members can share as much or as little as they like and have control over whom they want to share with.<br \/>49. There is a great sense of Community.<br \/>50. All over the place people are documenting their lives and sharing it with their friends and family.<br \/>51. It is a great place to learn from others and discover new ideas and sights.<br \/>52. In Flickr country there is a world of diversity, variety, tastes, attitudes, and different ways of seeing trough the eyes, the minds and lives of others.<br \/>53. There is plenty opportunities to connect with others who share specific interests, to work with them and be part of group projects.<br \/>54. The social fabric is close-knit and people make real friends in Flickrtown.<br \/>55. This makes them feel less inhibited, and it has helped many to open up.<br \/>56. People are less lonely because of Flickr.<br \/><br \/><b>Flickr's Nature<\/b><br \/><br \/>57. Flickr is a playful place and members like to have fun.<br \/>58. Commercial use is outlawed and this is valued highly.<br \/>59. It is not just a web site, but has a practical side to it &#8211; people shoot photos, edit their work, post and discuss their creations and debate issues.<br \/>60. Flickr is inspirational and allow everyone to become more creative.<br \/>61. The members are friendly and non critical. Most comments are positive. This makes Flickrtown a pleasant and inviting place, and it encourages participation.<br \/>62. Members display a lot of respect for each other.  Some trolls exist, but are quickly dealt with.<br \/>63. There are many subcultures within Flickr, and no particular style or theme dominates.<br \/>64. Members are tolerant and altruistic, and given to share and help rather than take.<br \/>65. A warning though: It can become quite addictive.<br \/>66. There is a great deal of concern if someone falls ill, or suddenly disappears.<br \/><br \/><b>Self-Fulfillment &amp; Learning<\/b><br \/><br \/>67. Flickr is a place where people find new ways to express themselves.  It's like having your own personal art show.<br \/>68. A great deal of inspiration, creativity and innovation takes place around the clock.  Not everyone gets enough sleep.<br \/>69. The fruit of their labor is quickly published and shared with others.<br \/>70. People love to contribute to this process by commenting upon the work of others and by selecting their favorite works from others.<br \/>71. We all learn and become aware of coincidences in space, where color and form collide in perfect harmony. This lifts our spirit and we tend to seek beauty in everything.<br \/>72. Many rediscover a dormant passion for photography that makes the blood run thicker and faster. They begin to see the world through the eyes of a lens, framing their perspectives and experiences. New dimensions are added to their perception.<br \/>73. Others see the world through a thousand lenses, directed by different people. This gives them a strong sense of proportion and a new awareness of what is possible.<br \/>74. Flickr turns everyone into an artist. It enables people to see the world around them in more depth and makes them aware of all the cool stuff they were missing.<br \/>75. Flickr is about contribution, about learning, about understanding.  It's the opposite of work!<br \/>76. People connect and exchange art and information, and their time on Flickr act as a distraction from the daily grind.<br \/>77. The Flickrati are free. They are freed from photo albums, free to define their own terms of copyright, and free to exchange their gifts.<br \/>78. Flickr becomes their collective memory.<br \/>79. Out of this emerges not only a way of life, but a celebration to life.<br \/>80. Flickr is whatever you want it to be...      <br \/><br \/> <span class=\"PostDateTime\">          Posted at 8:21pm, 20 May 2005 IST          (           <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/groups\/topic\/36512\/\" class=\"PostLinks\">Permalink<\/a>           )    <\/span> <\/p><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody> <\/table> <\/blockquote>Nice summary! <br \/><br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

            "content": "<p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div>I learned riding motor-cycle not very long time ago, mostly from my brother. We keep on having argument about my \"habit\" of pulling clutches while slowing down the bike, he maintains I should not, and just try to adjust gear based on current speed, otherwise the bike will skid. My \"philosophy\" is I will engage the engine only when I want to accelerate, as if I am applying brakes without pulling clutches I will make the break work against the kinetic energy of the bike as well as the kinetic energy of the engine rotation, not a smart thing to do when you want the bike to stop quickly. Also not disengaging engine when you don't need it lets the engine play a role in the bike dynamics, and under the wrong situation and wrong time it may be, umm, less than desirable. So I was pretty convinced that my strategy is the right one, and his skid theory is \"superstitious\".<br \/><br \/>Well today I was coming back after watching Starwars Ep. 3, which BTW is quite nice movie despite whatever you might have heard about it, its not easy to make a movie filled with robots and starships and lightspeed travels and jedis and sabers and remote planets and weird creatures and all, so human; when I had to drive on uphill patch of road with lots of muddy water spilled on it, that is always very scary thing for me, which is when I realized the concept of static vs dynamic friction, and everything suddenly made sense. So if you disengage engine ie pull clutch and apply brakes, and if the road is even little bit slippery, the wheel will just freeze, putting the tyre-road friction in the dynamic friction domain from the normal static-friction, resulting in nearly an order of magnitude lesser traction, and thus the skidding, whereas if you don't pull clutches, tyres breaks will have to stop both the engine and tyres, much more difficult to freeze and no skid.<br \/><br \/>My current strategy recommendation: if road is not wet\/oily and bike is light, use clutch if emergency stop is required, otherwise don't [if you are a person of habits, just don't]. Do drop in a comment if you think otherwise.<br \/><br \/>Having said that, technology is the best friend in situation like this, every bike should come with anti-skid brakes, and disk brakes, I don't know if they are really a good thing. <br \/><br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

No big deal, you just create an account and there you go. However, over time, the many, many user accounts with their passwords become hard to remember. A common solution is to have just one password for all of those sites, which are considered of low to medium risk if broken into. The problem with this is, that a rogue site owner might go out and impersonate as you, once they find out about other sites you may hang out with the same account. A little \"social engineering\", and you can be in big trouble. <\/p> <h2>The solution<\/h2> <p>Now there is nothing wrong with a single, strong password, as long as it is not used literally. Enter the concept of a Master Password that generates a strong password, unique for every web site where it is used. Password Composer does just that!<\/p> <p> Based on <a href=\"http:\/\/angel.net\/%7Enic\/passwdlet.html\">Generate Password<\/a> by Nick Wolff, this bookmarklet generates an unique password per site. The password is based on a md5 hash of your single master password and the site's host name. So one thing to keep in mind: slashdot.org will get a different password than www.slashdot.org, just be consistent! <\/p> <p>The advantage of this version - apart from the nifty panel rather than a bland Javascript popup - is that your master password is not exposed in clear text. Picture this: you are in a seedy Internet Cafe somewhere downtown, and that suspicious guy is looking over your shoulder while you happen to need to login your account... <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><\/p>The passwords are unique across sites, and depend on the master password you supply.

The proposal therefore seeks to incorporate int international IP law and practice, what developing countries have been demanding since TRIPS was forced on them in 1994.<br \/><br \/>The primary rationale for Intellectual Property protection is, first and foremost, to promote societal development by encouraging technological innovation. The legal monopoly granted to IP owners is an exceptional departure from the general principle of competitive markets as the best guarantee for securing the interest of society. The rationale for the exception is not that extraction of monopoly profits by the innovator is, of and in itself, good for society and so needs to be promoted. Rather, that properly controlled, such a monopoly, by providing an incentive for innovation, might produce sufficient benefits for society to compensate for the immediate loss to consumers as a result of the existence of a monopoly market instead of a competitive market. Monopoly rights, then, granted to IP holders is a special incentive that needs to be carefully calibrated by each country, in the light of its own circumstances, taking into account the overall costs and benefits of such protection.<\/blockquote><br \/>[Via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boingboing.net\/2005\/04\/15\/indias_amazing_state.html\">BoingBoing<\/a>.] <br \/><br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

There are 200 thousand gazillion open source projects on the internet, and I never had any problem figuring out their license, but this one is special, its by Microsoft. On the front page of IronPython they say:<br \/><blockquote>  IronPython-0.6 is now available as Open Source Software under the  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/legal\/cpl-v10.html\">Common Public License version 1.0<\/a>.   A single zip file containing both the source code and the binary executables can  be downloaded below. <ul> <li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ironpython.com\/IronPython-0.6.zip\">  IronPython-0.6.zip<\/a> released on July 28, 2004<\/li> <\/ul><\/blockquote> <br \/>What is CPL? This place <a href=\"http:\/\/www.research.att.com\/sw\/tools\/uwin\/faq.general.html\">says<\/a>: <blockquote> Can closed source applications use UWIN?   <p> The CPL license does not require you to make your source code available in order to use CPL software. The GPL license requires you to make source code available for any binaries that use GPL code. As long as you do not use any GPL code, you can use UWIN without making your source code available. <\/p> <\/blockquote><br \/>Very well, so we think its the typical run of the mill BSD like license, suitable for my application. I got further confidence after reading <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jasonmatusow\/archive\/2005\/04\/05\/IronPython_Q_and_A.aspx\">this<\/a>:<br \/><strong><\/strong><blockquote><strong>Q:<\/strong> How can Microsoft refer to the IronPython license as &#226;BSD-like&#226; when there are some obvious differences between the two?<br \/><strong>A:<\/strong> In an attempt to simplify the broad array of licenses available in the OSI-approved arena, there are permissive (BSD-like) licenses and reciprocal (GPL-like) licenses. It was under this premise that we referred to the IronPython license as BSD-like. You may want to check out my other <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jasonmatusow\/archive\/2005\/03\/10\/394009.aspx\">blog entry <\/a>on this topic.<\/blockquote><br \/>So far so good. Out of curiosity I decided to check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jasonmatusow\/archive\/2005\/03\/10\/394009.aspx\">blog entry<\/a> mention in last sentence there:<br \/><blockquote>Reciprocal grants are generally based on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/gpl-license.php\">GPL <\/a>style of license. Microsoft has a colorful history with this license, but the fact remains that this is a pervasive form of licensing. If one is to deeply understand the nature of <st1:city st=\"on\"><st1:place st=\"on\">OSS<\/st1:place><\/st1:city>, one has to think through reciprocal licensing. In fact, we have three <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/sharedsource\">Shared Source <\/a>projects (<a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/wix\">WiX<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/wtl\">WTL<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/flexwiki\">FlexWiki<\/a>) under a reciprocal license, the <a href=\"http:\/\/http\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/cpl1.0.php\">Common Public License<\/a>.<\/blockquote><br \/>Now they say CPL is reciprocal license, similer to GPL! [Totally unacceptable for my application]. Do they even know the difference? The blog write seems not to [he starts with a para on the meaning of \"open\" picked from encarta!], but why is such a person be the spokseman of licensing issues then? Scoble any explainations? Do you intentionally want to fool people into thinking it is BSD like while it actually is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotdotnet.com\/workspaces\/License.aspx?id=ad7acff7-ab1e-4bcb-99c0-57ac5a3a9742\">GPL like<\/a>?<br \/><blockquote>Clause 2: ... and if you distribute the Software solely in object form you only do so under a license that complies with this license.<\/blockquote><br \/>No, thankyou.

What it really is: it lets you create a login, and store the pages you comeacross, on their site as bookmarks. Furl also does it, but del.icio.us additionally lets you put tags on them. Another minor yet important feature is in del.icio.us you wont get duplicates if you \"furled\" it twice or more. This was my biggest problem with furl, infact I would never be able to decide if I have already furled it or not. Both <a href=\"http:\/\/del.icio.us\/rss\/upadhyay\">del.icio.us<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.furl.net\/members\/upadhyay\/rss.xml\">furl<\/a> provide RSS feeds [del.icio.us more organised as there are feeds for each tags too], but one thing that I am yet to find an equivalent of in del.icio.us that I liked in furl was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.furl.net\/faq.jsp#howShare\">daily email<\/a> of furled items of people you are subscribed too. I already have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloglines.com\/public\/upadhyay\">60 or so RSS feeds<\/a>, and I have become wary of adding new ones, information over load, so these emails acts as a push, and work well atleast for me. Important thing is to get only one mail per day for any number of subscriptions.<br \/><br \/>I guess the reason I switched to del.icio.us is tags, plus since it has an <a href=\"http:\/\/del.icio.us\/doc\/api\">open API<\/a>, people have created a <a href=\"http:\/\/pchere.blogspot.com\/2005\/02\/absolutely-delicious-complete-tool.html\">platohora of application around it<\/a>, which adds to its coolness.

As so often with k5 or \/., comments were more interesting than the original story, here are a few:<br \/><span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\"> <b><\/b><\/span><blockquote><span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\"><b>You missing the point entirely<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.kuro5hin.org\/comments\/2005\/3\/3\/153759\/8577\/76?mode=alone;showrate=1#76\">2.00 \/ 5<\/a>) (<a class=\"light\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kuro5hin.org\/comments\/2005\/3\/3\/153759\/8577\/76#76\">#76<\/a>)  <\/span><br \/> <span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kuro5hin.org\/user\/uid:17898\">greggman<\/a> on Fri Mar 4th, 2005 at 02:45:39 PM EST<br \/>(<a class=\"light\" href=\"mailto:http:\/\/greggman.com\/pages\/email.htm\">http:\/\/greggman.com\/pages\/email.htm<\/a>) <a class=\"light\" href=\"http:\/\/greggman.com\/\">http:\/\/greggman.com<\/a><\/span> <br \/> <span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">It's not about users editing the content.  It's not about business models.  It's not about sacred content.  It's about one company (one person) having a chance to edit every webpage for millions of people.<\/span> <p> <span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">Right now if you search for Bush you'll get lots of sites pro and con.  Pro sites will have pro links, con sites will have con links.  When version 1.1 of Autolinks appears that does more than the 4 types of data it does now then google will now have a chance to make all those links point one way or the other, pro or con.  That power will be concentrated in one company.  That is the scary part.  You think it's scary that people get most of their news from 4-5 TV news sources?  Just wait till the day when all online news sources pass through the editing hand of google and google alone.<\/span><\/p> <p> <span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">it's gets worse.  Assume google doesn't actually directly control the content but uses pagerank to decide where links to a certain topic go.  Then, who ever figures out how to hack pagerank (which many people have already done) will have a HUGE influence in shaping public opinion.<\/span><\/p> <p> <span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">Face it, techinically it's great idea.  Instead of manually searching for stuff with my personal phrase of preference (bush president, bush oil, bush iraq) each person deciding for themselves how to search, the convienence of Autolink 1.1 will be \"just click that button and I'll get links selected by google as the best links for more info\" and everyone else will get the exact same links.<\/span><\/p> <span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\">That's NOT good if you want diverse opinions.<br \/> <\/span><\/blockquote><br \/>And:<br \/><span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\"> <b><\/b><\/span><blockquote><span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\"><b>Opt-In for Content Providers?

But content producters <b>DO NOT<\/b> get to control how I view their content. This has been the way the web has worked since it began. The CLIENT is responsible for the presentation of the content. If I want to reformat it, add to it, do anything I want to it, I can do that. The thing is, <b>you can not stop this!<\/b> The server has no way of knowing what the client has done to the content after it has been sent.<br \/><br \/>There are already DOZENS of browser plug-ins and tools that alter or enhance web-page content in some form or fashion. If you suggest that content providers have some say in whether or not this happens, all of a sudden all of those devices have to support \"opt-in\" too.<br \/><br \/>Don't like those pop-up ads? Too fucking bad, we haven't \"opted in\" to allow you to block them.<br \/><br \/>If you try to make some stupid law and\/or standard that supports opt-in for content producers, that just means there will be \"underground\" browsers that do not support this feature. In other words, no one will be using Internet Explorer anymore, they'll be using 1nt3rn37 Xpl0r3r, because it has all the features of IE, without the limitation of forcing me to be at the mercy of the content provider. There is <b>no way<\/b> to avoid this! The server has SENT the data, it is now COMPLETELY in the hands of the client, and there is no way for the server to prevent the client from altering its presentation.<br \/><br \/>You want to talk about slippery slope. The slippery slope is there, but it's going the opposite way you think it is. You start suggesting that content-providers actually have some say in what is being displayed on the client end, and all of a sudden you've made just about every internet tool currently in existence illegal.<br \/><br \/>Now back to the main thrust -- <b>autolinking<\/b>:<br \/><br \/>I think it's a great tool if used responsibly. As long as the user of the software is <b>PERFECTLY AWARE<\/b> of where that link is being generated, and not able to confuse a link generated by the content provider and by the tool that is doing autolinking, I don't have a problem with it. As <a href=\"http:\/\/www.craphound.com\/bio.html\">Cory Doctorow<\/a> wrote on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boingboing.net\/2005\/02\/26\/why_you_should_love_.html\">BoingBoing<\/a>, the problem ONLY occurs if there is some deception involved, and that's a problem with whoever wrote the tool doing the decieving, not the actual technology of autolinking in and of itself.<br \/><br \/>As a user I would only be interested in this product, however, if it: <br \/><br \/>1. let me customize where the autolinks go to, for example, if it's autolinking a book, I want the option to have it search Barnes & Noble or Amazon.com as I see fit, not be forced into a choice by the maker of the tool just because they get \"kick-backs\".<br \/>2. no one gets a kick-back unless the author of the web page that I was reading gets one.<br \/>3. no one gets a kick-back if I don't want them to get a kick-back. It's my money, I get to decide who gets it.<br \/>4. I am always fully aware of where the link is being generated.<br \/>5. It's completely optional and \"turn-on per use\" type thing, it isn't something enabled all the time while browsing.<br \/><br \/>Those are my conditions before *I* would use it, YMMV. BTW, I am using Firefox so I can't use the Google thning even if it does work the way I want it to. I would be very interested in a FireFox plug-in that did something similar though.<br \/><br \/><br \/>--Knight37<\/span><span style=\"font-family:verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:85%;\"><br \/> <br \/>Once a Gamer, always a <a href=\"http:\/\/knightgames.blogspot.com\/\">Gamer<\/a> <\/span><br \/><\/blockquote><br \/>In general the modification is a Good Idea.

Will it stop India from sending its \"pride of the nation\" industry into a complete hell that it has been safe from till now? <\/p> <p> Stay tuned for the next gripping episode of \"a country commits intellectual suicide\", coming soon to a browser near you.   <\/p> <p> For now, here is the letter:   <\/p> <p> <i>To<br \/>Mr. T.K. VISWANATHAN Secretary to Government of India,<br \/>Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, Leader of the Indian National Congress, 10, Janpath,<br \/>Dr. Manmohan Singh Prime Minister of India<br \/>Shri Kamal Nath Minister for Commerce & Industry<br \/>L K Advani Leader of Opposition <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>David Hammerstein Member of the European Parliament Grupo Verde\/ALE <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>Subject: Software patents in the Parliaments of Europe and India <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>Dear fellow MP, <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>I am writing to you on the subject of software patents as Member of European Parliament. The European Parliament has opposed to make software patentable in September 2003, and in February 2005 the European Parliament by unanimous vote rejected a proposal by the Council of the European Union to request that. The debate is still open here, but speaking as a Parlamentarian I urge you to avoid any hasty and unwise steps in India. <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>During our debate, the US trade representative (for example in a letter of 16 September 2003) has argued that Europe was bound to have software patents due to the TRIPS treaty. We have now reached the understanding that in the making of TRIPS there is no indication that computer programs were to seen as a field of technology in the sense of TRIPS. Hence we clarified in Article 2 of our directive: \"(2) The use of natural forces to control physical effects beyond the digital representation of information belongs to a field of technology. The processing, handling, and presentation of information do not belong to a field of technology, even where technical devices are employed for such purposes\". <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>This is in accordance with art 52 (2)(c) of the European Patent Convention that states clearly that \"schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers\" shall not be regarded as inventions. <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>Moreover, article 10 of the TRIPs treaty also clearly demands protection by copyright for computer programs; TRIPS does not mention patent protection for computer programs at any place. <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>Given that the majority of software patent applications at the European Patent Office is from US and Japanese countries, having software patentable is clearly not in Europe's interest, and it is also likely also not to be in India's interest. <\/i><\/p> <p> <i>I would recommend either<br \/><\/i><\/p> <ul> <i><br \/><\/i><li>to amend the Indian law in the sense as outlined at <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.ffii.org\/InAmend0503En\" target=\"new\">http:\/\/wiki.ffii.org\/InAmend0503En<\/a> <p> <\/p><\/li><li>or just to keep the acceptable present wording of the Patent Act's 2002 version \"3 (k) a mathematical or business method or computer programme per se or algorithms\" and to reject the ambiguous wording that has it had been issued by the Minister of Industry Kamal Nath in December 2004 ordinance \"3 (k) a computer programme per se other than its technical application to industry or a combination with hardware; 3(ka) a mathematical method or business method or algorithms;\" <p> <\/p><\/li><li>or to improve the present wording of the Patent Act's 2002 version by simply deleting \"per se\" in \"3(k) a mathematical or business method or computer programme per se or algorithms\"<br \/><\/li> <\/ul> <i><br \/>With kind regards,   <\/i> <p> <i>David Hammerstein<\/i> <\/p> <p> Taken from <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.ffii.org\/Hammerstein050321En\" target=\"new\">http:\/\/wiki.ffii.org\/Hammerstein050321En<\/a> <\/p> <\/blockquote><br \/>I have talked about software patents in the past too, especially this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/2004\/11\/note-on-india-and-ipr.html\">note<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/2004\/12\/more-on-software-patents.html\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/2004\/12\/more-on-software-patents.html\">here<\/a>. I will just quote <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lessig.org\/blog\/archives\/002291.shtml\">Bill Gates on software patents<\/a>:<br \/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><blockquote>If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented and had taken out patents, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the industry would be at a complete standstill today<\/span>. The solution . . . is patent exchanges . . . and patenting as much as we can. . . . A future start-up with no patents of its own will be forced to pay whatever price the giants choose to impose. That price might be high: Established companies have an interest in excluding future competitors.<\/blockquote><\/span><br \/>Delhi Linux User Group has compiled a <a href=\"http:\/\/lug-delhi.org\/SoftwarePatentFAQ\">FAQ<\/a> on it.<br \/><br \/>The real question is not software patents are good or bad, but are they good or bad for <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">India Right Now<\/span>. On the minus we would limit a lot of people to do things, make a lot of people criminals. Government is granting people monopoly, one day in parliament costs couple of crores of Rupees, one law requires tens of crores more to complete the process once approved by parliament, then something of this magnitude, that is potentially going to make half of computer using population criminals is going to require thousands of crores to inforce if it is to be done effectively, I just want to see some studies that says they are worth it, that at the end of the day, in economic terms, India is going to profit from it.

It was developed in python, using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk\/pyqt\/index.php\">PyQt<\/a>. First, used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trolltech.com\/products\/qt\/designer.html\">Qt Designer<\/a>, and created the ui files (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/resizer\/imageresizer.ui\">imageresizer.ui<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/resizer\/imagepreviewer.ui\">imagepreviewer.ui<\/a>) and the implementations  (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/resizer\/imageresizer.ui.h\">imageresizer.ui.h<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/resizer\/imagepreviewer.ui.h\">imagepreviewer.ui.h<\/a>). These were translated to python source code using <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">pyuic.exe<\/span> that comes with PyQt. To test them I used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/resizer\/Image%20Resizer.py\">Image Resizer.py<\/a>. After playing with all these for couple of hours, when things started to look satisfactory, I started thinking about distribution. I have individually installed Python, Qt and PyQt, which not everyone has, <a href=\"http:\/\/starship.python.net\/crew\/theller\/py2exe\/#using-py2exe\">py2exe<\/a> to rescue! I had to create a small <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/resizer\/setup.py\">setup.py<\/a>, and run <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\"python setup.py py2exe <a href=\"http:\/\/aspn.activestate.com\/ASPN\/Mail\/Message\/py2exe-users\/2264332\">--includes sip<\/a>\"<\/span>, to generate self contained executable resolving all the dependencies. Then I had to create some icon file, and found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.x2studios.com\/index.php?page=products&amp;id=11\">LiquidIcon<\/a> quite handy. I wanted to add an item to right click context menu for image files in windows explorer, that will launch the resizer, not having any experiece with that, I found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jfitz.com\/tips\/rclick_custom.html\">this<\/a> very informative. The final step was to put everything together and creat an installer. I had two free options, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winamp.com\/about\/\">NullSoft<\/a>'s <a href=\"http:\/\/nsis.sourceforge.net\/\">NSIS<\/a> (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System), they have quite a few interesting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nullsoft.com\/pinkumbrella.phtml\">projects<\/a>; and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jrsoftware.org\/isinfo.php\">Inno Setup<\/a>. Both of them are quite cool, come with decent editors to speedup the work, have very little overhead on executable size, good compression etc. I went ahead with Inno Setup, as as soon as I had finished installing it, the editor popped up, opened a wizard, and I finished creating my first installer in less than the 5 mins Firefox told me the other fellow is going to take for download. I tweaked it a bit for next half an hour or so to get the registry setting working. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/resizer\/installer.iss\">installer.iss<\/a> (Open it in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.istool.org\/default.aspx\/\">ISTool<\/a>). Finally, putting together 7MB for Qt, 1MB for Python, and 20KB for my scripts, I got a 2.64MB <a href=\"http:\/\/us.f1f.yahoofs.com\/bc\/3c5bce20\/bc\/Fundoo\/ImageResizerInstaller.exe?bfqgdPCBNlpN0aL6\">installer<\/a>. <br \/> <br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

First I thought why don't Google do \"SETI\"(later realized they do something similer, but read on). People would obviously be willing to donate a few processor cycles to Google [we love Google!]. This I say because after all what a node at the Google's distributed systems is? quite close to my current system that is lying idle in my room while I am lunching. So for google it may make much more sense than for MSN search maybe [who probably is not using off the shelf components and have special requirements]. So I asked myself how will I (as Google) use this system? Well if people are willing to share bandwidth too, I may let the \"donated nodes\" fetch and index website [here by Index I mean compiling the raw text to some processed binary format, which will then further be used to search rank the pages at Google's site].<br \/> <br \/>But then I realised it would be only a marginal thing, wont really change things much, and then got this idea: What if websites index themselves? After all we know the difference between ftp-ing a directory and ftp-ing tar.gz for the same directory(with probably 1000s of small files). How about a googlify.exe that will create google.index which will be placed like robot.txt?<br \/> <br \/>Why?<br \/> <br \/>* Can save a bit of bandwidth, and much time (checking 100-1000 pages per website vs 1\/few, even if all you did is to check the last modification timestamp).<br \/>* Job of sanity checking and indexing can be distributed, reducing the load on the google servers (and hence much more detailed algos can be employed).<br \/> <br \/>Why would a website do that?<br \/> <br \/>Everyone wants to be ranked high. Everyone wants their latest content to be indexed by google soon. Everyone wants to optimize their bandwidth utilization. So lets say there is something like <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.google.com\/\">ping.google.com<\/a>, and  you can do a: <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.google.com\/?host=http:\/\/www.retrolabs.com\/google.index\">  http:\/\/ping.google.com\/?host=http:\/\/www.retrolabs.com\/google.index<\/a> after lets say when something on www.retrolabs.com gets modified and new google.index has been created, that will give the webmaster great deal of control on how quickly site shows up in google search results for changes just made.  <\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>[Small clearification: First question is how can you trust a google.index file to be authentic? But that you might be able to control by doing crazy\/smart things in Googlify.exe that site owners download from Google. Or everytime a googlify.exe \"pings\" the mothership, mothership \"signals\" random googlify.exe-s to check the authenticity of the index, and penalize a bad googlify.exe if required.]<br \/><br \/>I don't know if Google would do it, or if there would be the need of for them, they have immense infrastructure, but this is how opensource search engines will have to be if there is to be any. <br \/> <br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

You have to get noticed to get promoted.<br \/> 2.   You have to get noticed to get hired.<br \/>3. It really impresses people when you say \"Oh, I've written about that, just google for XXX and I'm on the top page\" or \"Oh, just google my name.\"<br \/>4. No matter how great you are, your career depends on communicating. The way to get better at anything, including communication, is by practicing. Blogging is good practice.<br \/> 5.   Bloggers are better-informed than non-bloggers. Knowing more is a career advantage.<br \/> 6.   Knowing more also means you're more likely to hear about interesting jobs coming open.<br \/> 7.   Networking is good for your career. Blogging is a good way to meet people.<br \/>8. If you're an engineer, blogging puts you in intimate contact with a worse-is-better 80\/20 success story. Understanding this mode of technology adoption can only help you.<br \/>9. If you're in marketing, you'll need to understand how its rules are changing as a result of the current whirlwind, which nobody does, but bloggers are at least somewhat less baffled.<br \/> 10.   It's a lot harder to fire someone who has a public voice, because it will be noticed.<\/blockquote><br \/>I don't know about that, infact I took some time convincing myself that posting that last reason is okay, I mean isn't it like blackmailing your boss? Blogging is a tool, per se not good or bad for anything, its how you use it, almost just like anything else. <br \/> <br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

Its a huge list of things a guy has \"agrued about\" with his Girlfriend. Its actually quite huge, so I am listing a few I liked:<br \/><blockquote>Margret is sitting at this computer (which is in the attic room, incidentally) typing something. I'm flopped in a chair close by with a paper and pad, scribbling away at a bit of work.<br \/>         I pause and say to her, 'Tortoise and turtle is the same word in German,              isn't it?'<br \/>She stops typing, reaches over, pulls off one of my Birkenstock shoes, throws it down through trapdoor (I hear it thud below, then flip-flop down the stairs) and returns to her typing. All in a single, silent movement.<br \/>         Your guess is as good as mine, frankly.<\/blockquote><br \/>and this one:<br \/><blockquote>If I'm sitting on the sofa reading a book and Margret enters the room she will say this: 'What are you doing?' If I'm peeling potatoes in the kitchen when she happens upon me, or pushing batteries into one of the children's extensive range of screeching toys, or writing on the side of a video cassette I've just pulled out of the recorder, the same thing: 'What are you doing?' I mean, a fellow likes to feel he's a bit enigmatic now and then, a tad mysterious and deep, but how can a person see me, for example, screwing a new bulb into a light fitting and <i>not be able to see immediately and with huge,              reverberating, chill clarity precisely what it is that I'm doing<\/i>? It's like living with Mork. It's not even as if I can use these moments to exercise my impressively sardonic (yet, at the same time, profoundly attractive and alluring in a deeply sexual way) wit either. Because, as previously mentioned, Margret regards large sections of what we on Earth call humour as nothing but shameless mendacity.<br \/>         Margret <i>[spotting Mil picking with his fingernail at the goo left              on a CD case by the price label]<\/i>: 'What are you doing?'<br \/>Mil: 'I'm talking to Mark using Morse code - he's at home right now holding one of his CD cases, picking up the vibrations I'm making.'<br \/>         Margret: 'No you're not, you liar. You're lying. Why do you always              lie? You liar.'<br \/>Mil: 'It works by resonance. You just have to practise for a bit to be able feel the plastic quivering - go over and get that Black Grape case, press it on to your nose, and we'll see if you can pick up anything.'<br \/>(There's the briefest flicker of indecision in her eyes; offering me, for one tantalising moment, the possibility that I'm going to spend the next ten minutes - 'What about <i>this<\/i>, then? Press it on your face harder.' - having quite simply the best of times... but then she grunts.)<br \/>         Margret: 'Liar. You're just a liar.'<br \/>Mostly, however, we've got it smooth and efficient now. We don't have to think. She says, 'What are you doing?', I peer at her with irritation and expel air, we go on about our business. This morning, though, she came upstairs to the attic here while I was sitting in front of the computer doing some work on the net.<br \/>         'What are you doing?' she asks.<br \/>Trying to concentrate on something, distracted and harassed, I reply with some degree of acerbic aggravation.<br \/>         'What does it <i>look<\/i> like I'm doing?'<br \/>         There's a beat, during which we hold each others eyes, unblinking.<br \/>         It's immediately after this beat has passed that I realise I'm wearing              no trousers.<br \/>There is, it's opulently redundant of me to add, a perfectly reasonable and innocuous explanation for why I'm browsing the web alone in my attic with no trousers on, but you're all busy people and I know you have neither the inclination nor the time to waste hearing it. As an image, however, it did rather undercut my sarcasm. Margret - in a brutally savage reversal of tactics - didn't speak. She merely raised her eyebrows and there, revealed, was a face that read, 'I have been waiting thirteen years for <i>this <\/i>moment.' <\/blockquote><br \/>or this:<br \/><blockquote>I was watching <i>Mission Impossible<\/i> and it was making me uneasy. Tom Cruise was doing something - infiltrating, probably, you know what he's like - and he was continuously describing the situation to his distant support buddies via his headset radio. For a while, I naturally assumed that it was simply Tom Cruise's big nose that was unsettling me and tried, using soothing visualisations and breathing exercises, to move myself, mentally, to a place where it wasn't an issue. But then - the realisation freezing my arm and abruptly halting a crisp's journey from bag to mouth - I had a small epiphany: 'Lawks,' I thought, 'This is my girlfriend.'<br \/> <i>\"Margret, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to wander around constantly articulating precisely what it is that you're doing at that moment, as though relaying it to an unseen control team somewhere. Possibly, on an alien mother ship, secretly orbiting the Earth. For example.\"<br \/> <\/i>She does this all the time. 'Get some eggs from the fridge... here's the butter... and now a frying pan... What's in the cupboard? OK, we've got oregano... some basil... I'll go for the mixed herbs... Now I need some scissors...' <i>Who is she talking to?<\/i> It's certainly not me: for one thing, I can see what she's doing - and, further, am not interested - and for another, I sometimes hear her doing this while she's alone in a room in another part of the house. And - though, admittedly, there's often a huge temptation to think she functions like this - I don't believe it's because she simply has no idea what she's going to do until it's actually occurring and I'm merely listening to her keeping her mind informed about what it is that her body appears to be doing right now. Sometimes we'll be sitting down watching TV and she'll get up and say, 'I'm going to the toilet.' Why would anyone say that? Does she think I'm keeping a log for research purposes? Is she intimating that she needs help? Does she have reason to expect that she may be abducted halfway up the stairs and thus wants me to at least be able to tell the police, 'Well, the last time I saw her I know she was on her way to the toilet.' <i>What<\/i>?<br \/>Surely, it can only be that she's an undercover member of the M.I. team. Every time a van is parked near our house now, I imagine Ving Rhames is in it; 'OK, the toilet's at the top of the stairs - it's unguarded, but has a slightly bent hinge...'<br \/>Oh, and the first person to say, 'Well, if she's doing an impossible mission, then that'd be 'living with you<i>'<\/i>, Mil, wouldn't                it?' gets a very slow handclap, OK?<\/blockquote><br \/>and:<br \/><blockquote>Margret: 'Mmm... Is anything in the world better than the feel of fresh bed sheets?'<br \/>Mil: 'Yes.'  <\/blockquote><br \/>I love these guys! Okay I will quote just one more:<br \/><blockquote>Do you remember the thing about 'Shut up'? It's not on this page anymore but, if you're an old-timer (or, I suppose, on the Mailing List and have read through the stuff that's no longer here) you might recall it. Well, she's sort of at it again.<br \/>I was looking for something that should have been somewhere, and wasn't. I asked Margret where it was, and she said, 'It's in the bedroom.'<br \/>'No, it isn't,' I replied - having just come from searching in the bedroom for about ten increasingly tantrumy minutes.<br \/>           'Yes, it is,' she repeated.<br \/>           'It's not. I've looked there.'<br \/>An expression of amused indulgence came over her face the subtleties of which I can't quite convey, so I'll have to make do with the description of it as, 'absolutely bleeding infuriating.'<br \/>           'How much,' she said, 'will you give me if I find it?'<br \/>OK, so this operates on two levels. The first is simple sadism. Margret knows the agony it would cause me if - after my prolonged, stomping insistence that <i>it isn't there<\/i> - she calmly walks over and places her hand immediately on it. Tauntingly, she knows that just the <i>possibility<\/i> of this happening is quite probably enough for my nerve to crack. She is well aware that if, just one more time, my frustrated raging of, 'The nail scissors aren't here. <i>See?<\/i> They're not bloody here. Do you understand? Not... Here...                Look! Go on! <i>You<\/i> try to find them then! Go on! Where are they then? Eh?' receives the near-instantaneous reply, 'Here they are,' and a pair of nail scissors, then I'm simply going to have to run away to sea. Can you see the other level, the one which ties it in kind with the 'Shut up' affair, though? Have a think.<br \/>That's it, well spotted: monetary gain. If I've maintained that something isn't somewhere until I've had to jump up and down, hold my breath and squeal that she's not my <i>real<\/i> mom, then simple, human decency should compel Margret to say, 'Yes, you're right,' rather than go there and find it. Going there and finding it is what you'd expect a Colombian Death Squad to do. What separates Margret from a Colombian Death Squad - perhaps the only thing that does - is subtlety. She's awfully keen to make that bet about finding things, isn't she? Now... why could that be? Well, obviously, it's because she's rigged the deck. The reason I can't find what I'm looking for is that she's previously spotted what I'm looking for, and moved it.<br \/>I have innate positioning instincts, you see: like a salmon returning thousands of miles across unmarked oceans, right to the stream where it was born. In exactly the same way, when I've finished using it, I will place a screwdriver on top of a bedroom radiator and - when I need it again, perhaps eighteen months later - unerringly return to that spot to retrieve it. Frequently, to discover that Margret has, maddeningly, taken it upon herself to transfer it to somewhere else. My instincts, moreover, are <i>incredibly<\/i> precise. If I'm looking for a pair of trainers that my astonishingly accurate positional memory remembers putting down in the bottom left of a cupboard, then I'm not going to notice them if some fiend has moved them to the bottom <i>right<\/i> of the cupboard during the intervening four and a half years, am I? That'd be stupid. What's the point of having a gift for such specific location if your visual perception is so vague as to wander around all over the place? Eh? What's more, I place things logically. Where are you most likely to need carpet tacks and a hammer, for example? Precisely. So leaving them on the stairs is simple ergonomics.<br \/>However, for some reason, Margret is unable to respect my filing system. She spends her day roaming the house, wilfully moving things from where I've deliberately placed them. And <i>that's<\/i> why she's keen to make the bet. She's hidden my stuff, and now she wants me to pay for her to retrieve it. It's basically a form of extortion, isn't it? Let's call a spade a spade: Margret has kidnapped my stuff and is holding it for ransom. Really, ladies and gentlemen, it's a sad state of affairs when your girlfriend abducts your favourite underpants.<\/blockquote><br \/>and this:<br \/><blockquote>A question I get asked a lot is... Um, actually, a question I get asked a lot is one I get asked by those Litigations R Us-style firms - the ones that encourage you to sue everyone you've ever met so they can have a share of the settlement. Every single time I walk through town one of their salespeople will leap out in front of me:<br \/>'Hello. I'm trawling for business on behalf of a parasitic company that happily feeds the special and delightful sense of greedy, self-centred victimhood that so elevates contemporary society. You can be confident of my noble legal stature because - look - I'm wearing a corporate waterproof jacket.'<br \/>           Hold on, let me start that again. I think I may have edged, just                slightly, into editorializing.<br \/>OK. Fact: I cannot walk through town without one these people heading me off. Their eyes shine the moment I stumble into their line of sight - they'll push other shoppers out of the way just to get at me. What does that say?

Have you had an accident within the last three                years?'<br \/>           Me: 'No. I always look like this.'<br \/>           I mean, it's basically someone coming up to you and saying, 'Hi                - <i>you<\/i> appear to be the result of some terrible catastrophe,'                isn't it?<br \/>           Maybe I should reassess my haircut or something.<br \/>Anyway, as I was saying before you set me off on that tangent, a question I get asked a lot is 'What's the most frequent argument you have?' I can't imagine why people ask me things like this. That is, I can't imagine why people ask <i>me<\/i> this - why don't they ask other people? If you want to ask about arguments, then ask an argument expert. I can't claim to be an expert, because I lack the vital aspect of depth - I can't provide a balanced answer, because I've simply no experience of what it's like to be in the wrong. I'd like to have that experience, obviously. In some ways I even feel vaguely cheated by my consistent rightness but, well, we have to play the hand we're dealt, right?<br \/>However, though I can't really say what the most frequent argument is, I can have a stab at the definitive one. This argument illustrates a fundamental theme - a core issue. Because of that, it can be used in all kinds of situations. The details are unimportant; the following example may be 'about' domestic chores, or shopping arrangements, or 'sorting out of children', or any number of things. Below those superficial, ephemeral points is the true heart of the matter. The argument goes:<br \/>           Margret: 'I cannot <i>believe<\/i> that you didn't do it.'<br \/>           Mil: 'You didn't ask me to do it.'<br \/>           Margret: 'Why should I have to <i>ask<\/i> you to do it?'<br \/>           Mil: 'So I know you want me to do it.'<br \/>           Margret: 'But I have to ask you to do everything.'<br \/>           Mil: 'But I do everything you ask me to.'<br \/>           Margret: 'But I have to ask you to do <i>everything<\/i>.'<br \/>           Mil: 'But I do <i>everything<\/i> you ask me to.'<br \/>           Margret: 'No - listen - the point is, I have to ask you to do <i>everything<\/i>.'<br \/>           Mil: 'Yes - and I do <i>everything<\/i> you ask me to.'<br \/>           [Some hours later....]<br \/>           Margret: '<i>I<\/i>... have to <i>ask<\/i>.... <i>you<\/i>... to do                <i>everything<\/i>.'<br \/>           Mil: 'And <i>I... <\/i>do <i>everything... you<\/i> ask me to.'<br \/>           Margret: 'Arrgggh! Listen! <i>I<\/i>...'<br \/>And so on. You see the problem, yes? The problem is that, for some reason, Margret is completely unable to grasp point that I do <i>everything<\/i>                she asks me to. You'd think that'd be a simple enough concept, wouldn't                you? Tch.<\/blockquote><br \/>and:<blockquote>Margret, had gone out. (It doesn't really matter where as, irrespective of her stated destination, she'll come back carrying another bloody plant.) As she'd left, she'd seen that I was sitting in front of the computer. If Margret is leaving the house and, as she's doing so, she sees me sitting in front of the computer, she <i>will<\/i>                say, 'Do the hoovering.' - there's no way she can stop herself:                it's Pavlovian.<br \/>Her 'Do the hoovering' had been followed by the clunk of the front door, the soft rumble of the car pulling away and then nothing but a silence in which I sat, pensive.<br \/>           I glanced around. OK, the carpets weren't <i>immaculate<\/i>, that was true. They were hardly in such a condition as to demand a hoovering, though. There's a clear point at which a carpet is ready for hoovering, in my opinion, and that point is \"when it's crunchy\". Even then, it's not what you'd call vital. In lots of the places I've lived, especially as a student, we never had a hoover at all. Sometimes, yes, walking across the landing required snow shoes - but no one ever died or anything. I glanced around some more.<br \/>           A few hours later, Margret returns.<br \/>After unloading around seventy-five new plants from the car, she hunts me down; finding me, by a fluke, sitting in front of the computer.<br \/>           'Have you hoovered?' she asks, her tone swaying unsurely between                conversational and murderous.<br \/>'What do you think?' I reply. (Cleverly, here, I'm indignant yet inscrutable - only my disdain for the question is clear; I provide no clue at all of the answer to it.)<br \/>           'Have you? Or not?'<br \/>           'Well, what does it look like?'<br \/>           'Just tell me whether you've hoovered.'<br \/>           'No. That's not the point.'<br \/>           'What? It's <i>completely<\/i> the point.'<br \/>           'No, it isn't. You thought the house needed<span style=\"font-size:100%;\">                hoovering. If you think it looks OK now, then you're happy, right?                Whether I've hoovered or not.'<br \/>           'And what if I <i>don't<\/i> think it looks OK?' She pauses for a moment, then adds, 'Or if I smash your laptop to pieces with a tyre jack?'<br \/>'If I've hoovered, and you still think it doesn't look hoovered... then there's no point my hoovering, is there? Ever again.'<br \/>There's a degree of glaring goes on here, but I hold my nerve and continue. 'The only other possibility, as far as I can see, is that you simply can't tell whether I've hoovered or not. And, if you can't tell, then it doesn't matter - in any real sense - whether I've <i>done<\/i> it or not, does it?' I've one more card to play, but it's a great one. 'That is, not unless the thing that concerns you isn't whether the house has been hoovered, but only whether I've been sitting here enjoying myself all this time rather than slogging around with a vacuum cleaner. But I'm <i>sure<\/i> that's not it. I mean, you'd be happy for me to sit here idle for as long as I want, wouldn't you, if there's no need for me not to? It's about the hoovering, not about my sitting here idle, isn't it?'<br \/>           Margret just stares at me.<br \/>I am triumphant. A choir sings. Cherubs circle my head, scattering petals. Shafts of golden light fan out from behind me. It's an intoxicating three seconds.<br \/>           'Clean out the fridge,' says Margret.<br \/><\/span><\/blockquote><br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, who<br \/>supports our opponents in an appalling way, told the press a<br \/>few days ago that this political process is in \"chaos\" without<br \/>precedent in the history of the EU. That's the way it should be:<br \/>A major injustice like software patents must not happen without<br \/>strong resistance from responsible politicians and citizens.<br \/><br \/>On Friday, Reuters reported that the EU Council has its proposal<br \/>for the software patent directive on the agenda for Monday,<br \/>as an A item, which means \"for debateless approval\".<br \/>To be very precise, it's a proposal for a proposal. If it were<br \/>to be adopted, it still wouldn't become law. It would, however,<br \/>become the EU Council's proposal that gets sent to the European<br \/>Parliament, and that is a very important step toward a directive.<br \/><br \/>Now, the latest news is that Denmark will side with Poland<br \/>(which is absolutely against the current proposal but said this<br \/>week that it can't fight all alone), and those two countries,<br \/>most probably with support from others, will stand up on Monday<br \/>in the EU Council (the legislative body in which the EU member<br \/>country governments cast their votes) and prevent a decision.<br \/>Those countries will ask for a renegotiation so that Europe will<br \/>hopefully see a much more balanced and well-thought-out directive<br \/>on the patentability of software concepts and functionalities.<br \/><br \/>A renegotiation of a Council text at this paticular stage would,<br \/>dependent upon whom you ask among EU insiders, either be without<br \/>precedent or there would be no more than one precedent in the<br \/>history of the EU (which passes like 1,000 regulations a year).<br \/><br \/>You can read about this latest (and exciting) development here:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nosoftwarepatents.com\/phpBB2\/viewtopic.php?t=428\">  http:\/\/www.nosoftwarepatents<wbr>.com\/phpBB2\/viewtopic.php?t<\/wbr><wbr>=428<\/wbr><\/a><br \/>(contains links to several articles, including one on ZDNet)<br \/><br \/>If you have a Web site with a lot of traffic, are on mailing lists,<br \/>know journalists or have time to make Slashdot submissions (Slashdot<br \/>mentioned the Danish story in a little note but not as a separate<br \/>article), then please help generate some more awareness over the<br \/>weekend. Some online media will still be able to report on this.<br \/><br \/>Also, here is a fake press release about the de-facto acquisition<br \/>of a part of the European Commission by Microsoft:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nosoftwarepatents.com\/phpBB2\/viewtopic.php?t=426\">http:\/\/www.nosoftwarepatents<wbr>.com\/phpBB2\/viewtopic.php?t<\/wbr><wbr>=426<\/wbr><\/a><br \/><br \/>It's a joke and most people usually figure it out but it looks<br \/>relatively realistic as I've been told :-)<br \/>If you mention this in a Slashdot submission, make it clear that<br \/>it's a joke. Otherwise there will be total chaos.<br \/><br \/>Now let's see what happens on Monday in Brussels.

Take the <code>p<\/code> element, which is used to denote paragraphs, and the <code>br<\/code> element, used to force a line break. Anyone ever commit this markup crime?<\/p> <p><code><\/code><\/p><p>If you place the line above in a document between some text sections, youll get some white space, but the markup has absolutely no meaning. A paragraph tag should be used to denote a paragraph, period. A line break should be used to force a break in a line, not to gain white space.<\/p> <p> I should be taken to markup prison and\/or fined for having done this for years! Fortunately, Ive got CSS by my side now, and can get back to cleaner living.<\/p> <\/blockquote><br \/>Question like should we put the quote in &lt;blockquote&gt; tag or &lt;i&gt; is dealing with <a href=\"http:\/\/brainstormsandraves.com\/articles\/semantics\/structure\/\">semantics<\/a>. This person <a href=\"http:\/\/www.molly.com\/2005\/02\/27\/the-meaning-of-semantics\/#comment-8060\">tries to justify<\/a> why choosing the one that is semantically correct is better thing to do.<br \/><br \/>Consider Google's latest toolbar's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/support\/toolbar\/bin\/static.py?page=features.html\">AutoLink<\/a> as an example, it parses the current page you are viewing and converts data in it like ISBN number of books, to Amazon page listing for that book; and address information to a GoogleMap page that shows direction from your current location to the given address. Imagine a tool that looks at the page you are viewing, finds &lt;blockquote&gt;, does a google search on it and finds the original site, and creates small button near the quoted text, clicking on which will show the original text with the quoted text highlighted. Or a tool that finds the abbreviations and shows a tooltip containing the full form for it when you hover the mouse over it. All this services would be useful innovations, but creating them would become extremely difficult if people do not put the abbreviations in &lt;abbr&gt; and for say we will just put them in &lt;b&gt; do it consistently for our sites and our visitors will know it, and not put addresses in &lt;address&gt; and say we just show them in deep red font, or put all the &lt;blockquote&gt; material in &lt;i&gt;s. If everyone is creating standards, there is no standards at all.<br \/><br \/>After ignorance,  the most important reason people ignore semantics is the fact that it used to be difficult to achieve the desired look at times without breaking semantics, but with CSS we have complete control, take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/css.maxdesign.com.au\/listamatic\/\">this<\/a> for example, that that reason no longer is valid. So  therefore respect semantics, not doing so may be hindering innovation. <br \/><br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

Some context information to appreciate the real significance of this story is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.russellbeattie.com\/notebook\/1008231.html\">here<\/a>, as I talked about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/2005\/01\/russ-on-microsofts-endgame.html\">earlier<\/a>. Microsoft is putting pieces of its plan together, but I think something else might be going on here too. They recently announced support for <a href=\"http:\/\/press.nokia.com\/PR\/200501\/978226_5.html\">Python<\/a> on their devices, and then brought <a href=\"http:\/\/www.russellbeattie.com\/notebook\/1008305.html\">Macromedia Flash<\/a> into the picture. They also silently developed a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootshell.be\/%7Eupadhyay\/2004\/10\/nokia-browser.html\">Nokia Browser<\/a> and licensed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmeurope.com\/default.asp?ArticleID=6043\">ActiveSync<\/a> from Microsoft, for emails and stuff. Russ says Nokia-MS deal is a precursor to a Nokia branded Windows Mobile phone but if  you put it all together, it seems on contrary. Nokia seems to have no plans to switch to Windows Mobile, [though they would probably roll out a few models with Windows Mobile to meet the demands of higher end users], rather they focusing on their own platform(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.forum.nokia.com\/main\/1,6566,1_32,00.html\">Symbian<\/a>) and are putting great efforts in enhancing it. If this is so we may also expect some licensing deals of Nokia with Apple for their iTunes service [this would blow a hole in Motorola's hopes of playing an important role in possible Microsoft-Nokia vs Apple-Motorola checkmate scenario if Nokia ignored Apple].<div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

It must be like reading an Iraqi blog during the war years.<br \/><br \/>Apart from the side-taking, I find it very interesting how an iron curtain has developed between MS-crowd and OSS-crowd. Even in other companies there are MCSEs and MCSDs on one hand who insist<nobr> <wbr><\/wbr><\/nobr>.NET is the future, and the not-so-well-dressed OSS crowd. Working on cheaper hardware, trying always to run their latest game on gentoo.<br \/><br \/>Its a war of Nerds vs Geeks. The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Regardless of all bias, both sides are fully functional, both producing products and distributing it to the world. Somehow it does remind me of the cold war days, MS being the USSR simply because its closed, considered sinister, has a big arsenal, and has citizens who want to emigrate.<br \/><br \/>Different people enjoy working different places. I always enjoy work when I know I'll get paid for it. I also sometimes enjoy starting little OSS projects, my pet projects that I very excruciatingly design, plan, and start... just for the kicks and to see if I can make something better, but most of which die before beta. At work, we use both OSS and commercial OSes and software. Both philosophies are at war in every quarter, and despite what the slashdot (or microsoft) crowd might think, right now neither group has the overwhelming strength. Thats why so many companies HAVE to run a linux\/BSD firewall, and a windows domain controller. Sure I can run a samba domain controller, but in some ways (beside security) its like running a Windows 2000 professional firewall.<br \/><br \/>I wouldnt mind working at Redhat AND at Microsoft. Given the options, I'll choose whichever pays me more. I suspect I'll hate the work at MS, because I'm biased, have been since 96 when I tried slackware 3.0. Theres also a kind of an addictive nomadic freedom related to opensource programming, which occasionally makes up for the lack of $$$.<br \/><br \/>I dont think Microsoft will disappear, just as I dont think the x86 architecture will disappear. There are far too many games for me that arent ported to Linux or MacOS. There are far too many applications that require win32 API to run, and running them in WINE makes em less stable not more. The whole reason why Microsoft is bigger than Apple, is why Microsoft will stick around... but Linux will certainly come of age. This competition is bound to intensify.<br \/><br \/>I love Linux. It probably will not make one man extremely rich, but it will not only bring more freedom, yet complexity to desktops, it will also bring with it BSD and all other OSes which never had the chance before. Linux actually is a favor to Solaris and MacOS. Currently theyre competitors of sorts, but Linux will make portable applications the fashion. The huge source base that Linux and BSD have created will all run perfectly on both OSX and Solaris and the rest, giving them life (would you rather run Netscape 4.75 or Firefox 1.0 on AIX?), think of the free databases we now have.<br \/><br \/>As much as we love to bash Microsoft and hope Linux will be the saviour, too many of us still log onto slashdot from our Windows machines, to bash Microsoft.

A PHP\/Python programmer is a bad HTML designer and vise versa, and a separation is required. I knew this since very long but not exactly how to do it, but finally came across two approaches to the separation: htmltmpl (<a href=\"http:\/\/htmltmpl.sourceforge.net\/python.html#example-simple\">hello world example<\/a>) and XSLT (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/xsl\/xsl_transformation.asp\">hello world example<\/a>) [both rely on some kind of templatization, HTML designer produces the templates, while programmer provides data to fill in the template]. Later is ofcourse superior as its a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xslt\">webstandard<\/a>, would be supported by nearly every programming framework if not already, and data is cleanly separated from both data churner and date presenter, but the downside is it has steeper learning curve and requires learning lots of mumbo jumbo like XML, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xmlfiles.com\/xsl\/xsl_intro.asp\">XSL<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/xpath\/xpath_intro.asp\">XPath<\/a> and XSLT, while former may be much easier to get to speed with. One or other must be used for generating all the (dynamic) HTML content on the web.<div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

Look around you. Whatever happened to the Telgi Stamp Paper Scam, or the Hawala Scandal? Or even the issue of the plight of the Indian hockey team? And the papers are filled with pages and pages of \"page 3\" material, and cricket analysis which dvelve deep into the type to soil on the pitch and the weight of Sachin's bat. The \"dollar vote\" argument is indeed true. The media will produce what the people are willing to pay for. Simple market economics. But then this very argument is the strongest case for regulation of the media, to an extent. The media is at least as crucial, if not more, than any of the other three modern \"estates\". Are we willing to \"outsource\" the legislature to a \"free market\", non-elected, non-answerable, lowest-bid corporation? I hope we're not. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The media has a responsibility. And if the free market pressures do not allow the media to fulfill that, then the free market has to go.<\/span> <br \/><\/blockquote> <br \/>And concludes with:\r<br \/><blockquote>I'm all for the freedom of thought and expression, and the derived freedom of the press. I should be able to say what I want to, or raise any issue that I feel the need to, but there has to be *some* direction. Otherwise, we'll end up as a country where the North does not know the South, and the East goes the opposite to the West. Some people argue that this has already started to happen. We'll all become \"page 3\" junkies, where the ambitions of kids would not be to \"become a doctor to help the poor\", but to become \"miss India\". But how would the regulation happen? How do we keep the regulation itself in check, so as to not encroach upon the freedom of the press to raise real issues? One possible answer is to have smaller media entities. \"Media houses\" and cartels should be dissovled, or atleast regulated. The extent of regulation should depend on how big the media conglomerate is. This has obvious problems too. Infact, me or you cannot think up of a solution. Neither can anyone else. The public has to decide collectively. And it is no one other than the media itself which can initiate and carry this public debate. Another <em>Catch-22<\/em>.<\/blockquote> <br \/>In my opinion, he is not far from right, he has identified an issue, media is our eyes, and no one can think all is well with them in India, but he is not quite right either as regulation can not, will not and should not happen to solve that problem. My personal opinion on the state of media is, for some reason its highly depersonalised, we never see any person behind a news, the news reader has no personality. We don't have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/newsitems\/200411\/s1250213.htm\">celebrated<\/a> news anchors, we don't have our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/CNN\/anchors_reporters\/king.larry.html\">Larry King<\/a>s. And that is the silver bullet, the \"dollar vote\" has not been casted yet [who would think media people are making hoardes of money, they are just surviving], and the best part is it does not require any social revolution or govt. regulation, free market itself has all the incentives to inspire budding journalists (bloggers?) and infrastructure to support the talented ones. We have seen some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rediff.com\/news\/varsha.htm\">flickers<\/a>, and I am sure its only a matter of time.\r<br \/> <br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

Or so we thought before something happened in 1998 in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Australian National University:\r<br \/><blockquote>... they could not believe their own data. Some unknown force was pushing the galaxies apart, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. Brian Schmidt, one of the group leaders, said, \"I was still shaking my head, but we had checked everything&#226;&#346; I was very reluctant to tell people, because I truly thought that we were going to get massacred.\"\r<br \/> <br \/>Physicists went scrambling back to their blackboards and realised that some \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dark_energy\">dark energy<\/a>\" of unknown origin, akin to Einstein's \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosmological_constant\">cosmological constant<\/a>,\" was acting as an anti-gravity force. Apparently, empty space itself contains enough repulsive dark energy to blow the universe apart.

Your vacation. Procrastination is like taking that vacation right now. If you can't take a vacation at the end of a year of hard work, you might as well take it now because there is no reward for finishing your work.<\/p> <p>When I was in kindergarten I got a letter sent home. I wish I had it framed because it explained so much about my personality for so many years. It said:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>Mark doesn't distinguish between work and play. He continues to play when it's time to work, and work when it's time to play.<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Most books on procrastination will tell you that it's important to separate work from pleasure. That you procrastinate because you don't know when you will be able to take some time to relax, and that by creating clear times where you're not allowed to do work, you give yourself permission to do work at other times.<\/p> <p>I'd say this is half true. The problem with it is that there's still no clear reason to do the work. If I work 9 to 5, I don't work when I get home, yet much of my day at work is wasted too. Why? Because there is no reward for completing the work. If I complete the work, I'm still at my job, so what incentive do I have? <\/p> <p>Well, what would Nanny 911 do? She would take away everything you use to procrastinate, and not give it back until you finished your work. No exceptions, because an exception is a random reinforcer.<\/p> <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Procrastination 101 <\/p> <p>Procrastination is a habit. People aren't born procrastinators or hard workers, it's something you learn, like biting your fingernails. Luckily, it can be unlearned as well. <\/p> <p>If you study people while they're working, you'll find that a single behavior or set of behaviors predict when you're about to procrastinate. These are like poker tells. Unconscious twitches that signal you're about to stop working. If you can figure out what these behaviors are and remind yourself to get back to work whenever it happens, you can stop the interruptions.<\/p> <p>These procrastination events come in basically three flavors. The first are events that come to you - the phone ringing, someone knocking on your door, etc. The second are things that depend outside objects, but that you initiate like getting up to go to the candy machine. The third are purely internal events, just zoning out and daydreaming.<\/p> <p>If you can change your environment to get rid of the distraction, you should do it. Sometimes these environmental variables are more subtle than you realize. A memento on your desk could trigger a pleasant daydream, or a bill could trigger some abstract financial worry. They key here is to recognize when these distractions are tied to objects, and then get rid of those objects.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>See blogging even helps learn fight procrastination :P Get back to work <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marktaw.com\/getbacktowork.htm\">now<\/a>.\r<br \/><\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

This I use to arrive at another maxim which says we should never take decisions. When we are taking decisions, we are taking n bits of information and trying to arrive to one summary for that. When we decide something is good or bad, we take in lots of input(pros and cons to that decision, pros won), but after the decision is taken we have the tendency to discard the cons pieces of information. Why we do it is because we find ourselves incapable of handling these information, ofcourse sometimes we also take decisions to act on them, but the constraint that makes the decision mandatory is obviously an evil thing and measures should be taken to avoid them. Root of all evil in the world according to some Indian philosophies is to assume there is a good\/bad right\/wrong distinction, which is what we are doing all the time when we are making decisions, which we do because not many people believe in infinite memory\/information capacity thing. This is the same heart vs mind argument we keep hearing about, how we should follow our heart and stuff, as soon as the reason for doing a thing becomes \"because I like to\" from \"because it is right\", the world becomes very nice place, tho ofcourse I can not prove it, which is okay given the topic of the blog I guess :P. There is a major difference between what Hinduism tells you and what other religions, we take \"religion\" as something that tells you what is \"the right thing to do\" (and many religions elaborate in great details about what will happen if you do or don't do them), but Veda's start with a declaration that you can not take books, sensory perception, rational deductions, memory etc as a source of reliable information. Veda's don't want you to make any decisions, unless you have found the truth, and a good check to see if so is the case is to try to fly through the buildings, if you can't you are not the one, and you haven't found the truth yet, so just drop your stupid assumption that you know anything enough to make any decision. BTW Gita goes in long details how to cope with this uncertainty, but in short I can say you try to find your type, what makes your most comfortable, and do it, don't try to do what other types do [bad thing they dwelled on the type concept too long and invented the caste system, anyways].\r<br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

The energy released in the fusion reactions prevents the star from collapsing under its own gravity, and the star is stable.<\/p> <p>After several billion years, the star runs out of hydrogen, and there is no longer enough energy flowing out from the core to support the outer layers of the star. The core thus contracts and heats up. Currently the sun's core has a temperature of approximately 15 million <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kelvin\" title=\"Kelvin\">K<\/a>, but when it runs out of hydrogen, the contraction of the core will cause the temperature to rise to about 100 million K.<\/p> <p>The outer layers of the star expand enormously because of the very high temperature of the core, and become much cooler. The star becomes a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Red_giant\" title=\"Red giant\">red giant<\/a>. The core continues to contract and heat up, and when its temperature reaches 100 million K, helium nuclei begin to fuse into <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carbon\" title=\"Carbon\">carbon<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oxygen\" title=\"Oxygen\">oxygen<\/a>. The resumption of fusion reactions stops the core's contraction. Helium burning soon forms an inert core of carbon and oxygen, with a helium-burning shell surrounding it.<\/p> <p>Helium fusion reactions are extremely temperature sensitive, with reaction rates being proportional to T<sup>40<\/sup>. This means that just a 2% rise in temperature more than doubles the reaction rate. This makes the star very unstable - a small rise in temperature leads to a rapid rise in reaction rates, which releases a lot of energy, increasing the temperature further. The helium-burning layer rapidly expands and therefore cools, which reduces the reaction rate again. Huge pulsations build up, which eventually become large enough to throw off the whole stellar atmosphere into space<sup>[3]<\/sup>.<\/p> <p>The ejected gases form a cloud of material around the now-exposed core of the star. As more and more of the atmosphere moves away from the star, deeper and deeper layers at higher and higher temperatures are exposed. When the exposed surface reaches a temperature of about 30,000K, there are enough <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultraviolet\" title=\"Ultraviolet\">ultraviolet<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Photon\" title=\"Photon\">photons<\/a> being emitted to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ionisation\" title=\"Ionisation\">ionise<\/a> the ejected atmosphere, making it glow.

More recently tsunamis had struck India in 1988 and 1998 killing 3 and 2, respectively. Defending the costs of deploying a system before December 2004 would have been difficult.

Pretty interesting idea in fact, foreigners have problems with local language, and a PDA can be packed with travel guidelines, translation programs, audio and video instructions to reach places and all. In fact the translator software can also speak out in local languages saving the poor visitor exercising his vocal skills. With images and video, tourists will get much better idea of what to expect on all the possible tourist spots and can make more informed decisions. Hyperlink nature of digital content and facility to search makes it orders of magnitude more useful for documentation than paper pamphlets. And if the cost of PDA is a concern they can allot it based on Passport and collect it when the tourists leave the country. Should save the PDA from becoming extinct I guess.\r<br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

If more than one person is using the same login on some machine and both are using screen, it may be advisable to use caution when doing this. <\/p> <p> Other cool thing to play with is: <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-S<\/strong> [capital S] to split the screen vertically in half, <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-Q<\/strong> to unsplit and <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-Tab<\/strong> to move focus to other side of split. <\/p> <p> Also to list the currently open screens in a screen sessions, <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-\"<\/strong>, and to rename the current screen to a more meaningful name do a <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-A<\/strong> <\/p> <p> With all this <strong>Ctrl-a<\/strong> business if you miss sending Ctrl-a to the running program(for example to jump to the beginning of the readline buffer used to edit the commands we are passing to bash), do a <strong>Ctrl-a a<\/strong>. <\/p> <p> You can also instruct screen to monitor a screen for silence by <strong>Ctrl-a Ctrl-_<\/strong> [underscore], good to know when a program has stopped running in one of the hidden windows. <\/p> <p> Now I am sure it would be hard for you to live without screen. :-) <\/p> <p> One minor drawback: screen retains the DISPLAY setting of the terminal where it was first created, so if I want to quickly launch emacs etc, I detach, run the program and reattach again.\r<br \/><\/p> <p>PS: Had written this for my company documentation! <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kuro5hin\">K5<\/a> has another <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kuro5hin.org\/story\/2004\/3\/9\/16838\/14935\">tutorial<\/a> about it.

According to me they are missing the point, despite all my aversions I have become quite a frequent blogger, and Google's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\">Blogger.com<\/a> is offering the best blog service. Initially they had paid features, but it is now completely free, contrast it with Microsoft's <a href=\"http:\/\/spaces.msn.com\/\">Spaces<\/a>, which even their paid <a href=\"http:\/\/scoble.weblogs.com\/\">PR blogger<\/a> couldn't <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0001011\/2004\/12\/02.html#a8788\">recommend<\/a>. Then take Google's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.orkut.com\">Orkut<\/a>, a very popular site in the social network I belong, it has all the things you might need from a service like this, no ads, no spam mails. Or take <a href=\"http:\/\/www.picasa.com\/picasa\/\">Picasa<\/a>, Google's photo organizer, I would rate it as one of the best and coolest I have seen so far, so much so it made me want to buy a digicam just so that I get something to organize using it. Or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hello.com\/\">Hello<\/a>, a companion to Picasa, kind of an instant messenger integrated with photo viewer and blogger. Just download these software and see the kind of coolness and ease of use they have, they do what you expect them to and stay out of your way, and this I can say for all the services offered by Google I mentioned here.\r<br \/> <br \/>It is always tempting to remember Netscape and think would Google go that way as if it were a product, what it really is a provably smart group of people with great insight into the mind of customers, and an ability to deliver.

But if previous giant quakes in the region are any guide, the one Sunday would have suddenly pushed up the ocean bottom by a yard or two, raising a bulge of water on the surface that rippled out in all directions.<\/p> <p>The resulting waves, or tsunamis, would have been only a foot or so tall as they raced across the ocean at 500 to 600 mph.<\/p> <p>But when they hit shallower water near shore, they piled up into walls of water up to 30 feet high, depending on the shape of the coastline and the contours of the ocean bottom.<\/p> <p>The tsunamis might look like angry waves or rapidly rising tides. As the first one receded, exposing the ocean bottom, people would have been tempted to go gather up any fish left behind, only to be trapped by a second wave as powerful as the first, arriving 10 minutes to an hour later. Four or five tsunami waves may hit in succession, traveling thousands of miles to menace distant shores.<\/p> <p>Sunday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake occurred in an area about 125 miles off the west coast of Sumatra that is marked by a deep trench.<\/p> <p>Based on clues found among the area's coral reefs and along its beaches, scientists know this is the fourth giant earthquake to strike the same fault zone, known as the Sumatran subduction zone, since 1797.<\/p> <\/blockquote> <br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

            "content": "<p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><blockquote style=\"font-style: italic;\">In both Secrets and Lies and Beyond Fear, I discuss a key difference between attackers and defenders: the ability to concentrate resources. The defender must defend against all possible attacks, while the attacker can concentrate his forces on one particular avenue of attack. This precept is fundamental to a lot of security, and can be seen very clearly in counterterrorism. A country is in the position of the interior; it must defend itself against all possible terrorist attacks: airplane terrorism, chemical bombs, threats at the ports, threats through the mails, lone lunatics with automatic weapons, assassinations, etc, etc, etc. The terrorist just needs to find one weak spot in the defenses, and exploit that. This concentration versus diffusion of resources is one reason why the defender's job is so much harder than the attackers.\r<br \/> <br \/>This same principle guides security questioning at the Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. In this example, the attacker is the security screener and the defender is the terrorist. (It's important to remember that \"attacker\" and \"defender\" are not moral labels, but tactical ones. Sometimes the defenders are the good guys and the attackers are the bad guys. In this case, the bad guy is trying to defend his cover story against the good guy who is attacking it.)\r<br \/> <br \/>Security is impressively tight at the airport, and includes a potentially lengthy interview by a trained security screener. The screener asks each passenger questions, trying to determine if he's a security risk. But instead of asking different questions -- where do you live, what do you do for a living, where were you born -- the screener asks questions that follow a storyline: \"Where are you going? Who do you know there? How did you meet him? What were you doing there?\" And so on.\r<br \/> <br \/>See the ability to concentrate resources? The defender -- the terrorist trying to sneak aboard the airplane -- needs a cover story sufficiently broad to be able to respond to any line of questioning. So he might memorize the answers to several hundred questions. The attacker -- the security screener -- could ask questions scattershot, but instead concentrates his questioning along one particular line. The theory is that eventually the defender will reach the end of his memorized story, and that the attacker will then notice the subtle changes in the defender as he starts to make up answers.<\/blockquote> <br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.schneier.com\/blog\/archives\/2004\/12\/security_notes.html\">says<\/a> Bruce Schneier, who is a very vocal security expert, author of some of the most authentic <a href=\"http:\/\/www.schneier.com\/books.html\">books<\/a> related to security and encryptions, has an interesting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.schneier.com\/blog\/\">blog<\/a> and runs <a href=\"http:\/\/mailapp.modwest.com\/mailman\/listinfo\/crypto-gram-list\">Crypto-Gram<\/a> newsletter.\r<br \/> <br \/><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

Imagine if every American kid, in every school, were galvanized around such a vision. Ah, you say, nice idea, Friedman, but what does it have to do with your subject - foreign policy?\r<br \/> <br \/>Everything! You give me an America that is energy-independent and I will give you sharply reduced oil revenues for the worst governments in the world. I will give you political reform from Moscow to Riyadh to Tehran. Yes, deprive these regimes of the huge oil windfalls on which they depend and you will force them to reform by having to tap their people instead of oil wells. These regimes won't change when we tell them they should. They will change only when they tell themselves they must.\r<br \/> <br \/>When did the Soviet Union collapse? When did reform take off in Iran? When did the Oslo peace process begin? When did economic reform become a hot topic in the Arab world? In the late 1980's and early 1990's. And what was also happening then? Oil prices were collapsing.\r<br \/> <br \/>In November 1985, oil was $30 a barrel, recalled the noted oil economist Philip Verleger. By July of 1986, oil had fallen to $10 a barrel, and it did not climb back to $20 until April 1989. \"Everyone thinks Ronald Reagan brought down the Soviets,\" said Mr. Verleger. \"That is wrong. It was the collapse of their oil rents.\" It's no accident that the 1990's was the decade of falling oil prices and falling walls.<\/blockquote><\/span> <br \/>I would highly recommend bookmarking NYTimes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/pages\/opinion\/index.html\">Opinion<\/a> page, and watching Friedman's columns regularly.

And a standard around that that notifies you that something has changed called RSS.\r<br \/> <br \/>This is a very interesting thing, because whenever you want to send e-mail you always have to sit there and think who do I copy on this. There might be people who might be interested in it or might feel like if it gets forwarded to them they'll wonder why I didn't put their name on it. But, then again, I don't want to interrupt them or make them think this is some deeply profound thing that I'm saying, but they might want to know. And so, you have a tough time deciding how broadly to send it out.\r<br \/> <br \/>Then again, if you just put information on a Web site, then people don't know to come visit that Web site, and it's very painful to keep visiting somebody's Web site and it never changes. It's very typical that a lot of the Web sites you go to that are personal in nature just eventually go completely stale and you waste time looking at it.\r<br \/> <br \/>And so, what blogging and these notifications are about is that you make it very easy to write something that you can think of, like an e-mail, but it goes up onto a Web site. And then people who care about that get a little notification. And so, for example, if you care about dozens of people whenever they write about a certain topic, you can have that notification come into your Inbox and it will be in a different folder and so only when you're interested in browsing about that topic do you go in and follow those, and it doesn't interfere with your normal Inbox.<\/blockquote><\/span> <p> From <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/billgates\/speeches\/2004\/05-20CEOSummit.asp\">one<\/a> of the Bill Gates <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/billgates\/speeches.asp\">speeches<\/a>. <\/p> <p> Via <a href=\"http:\/\/steverubel.typepad.com\/micropersuasion\/2004\/05\/pearl_harbor_ii.html\">Micro Persuasion<\/a>. <\/p><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div>",

This meant that, for the first time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the ownership of the most critical tool of production in the most critical industry of the world's leading economy was readily affordable by the individual worker. Throughout the first three decades of the Information Age, the individual worker was still dependent on his employer for his means of production, just as any textile worker in Manchester or Lawrence was in 1840.\r<br \/> <br \/>Suddenly, this changed. Now it is as if a steelworker could afford his own blast furnace or rolling mill, an automobile worker his own assembly line.

He hates how hard it is to add contacts and make calls and he cringes at the web experience and the Java games, if he's even bothered to try them. He holds it in his hand during long trips and admires some things about it, but knows *he could do it better.* He knows that if Apple decided to make a mobile phone, it would be the most intuitive and elegant mobile phone in the world.

These prominent blogs serve as a mechanism for filtering interesting blog posts from mundane ones. When less renowned bloggers write posts with new information or a new slant, they will contact one or more of the large focal point blogs to publicize their posts. In this manner, poor blogs function as fire alarms for rich blogs, alerting them to new information and links. This self-perpetuating, symbiotic relationship allows interesting arguments and information to make their way to the top of the blogosphere.\r<br \/> <br \/>... as the museum looting controversy reveals, blogs are now a &#65533;fifth estate&#65533; that keeps watch over the mainstream media. The speed of real-time blogger reactions often compels the media to correct errors in their own reporting before they mushroom.\r<br \/> <br \/>...Yale University law Professor Jack Balkin says, the blogosphere has some built-in correction mechanisms for ideological bias, as &#65533;bloggers who write about political subjects cannot avoid addressing (and, more importantly, linking to) arguments made by people with different views. The reason is that much of the blogosphere is devoted to criticizing what other people have to say.&#65533;\r<br \/><\/blockquote><\/span> <br \/>Read it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\/story\/cms.php?story_id=2707\">here<\/a>. <div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

I realize that algorithms lie in that grey area between a mechanical process (which is patentable) and an abstract idea (which is not), but at a purely practical level I think that software patents generally do much more harm than good. As such, I'd like to see them go away and the US patent office focus on more productive tasks. I have nothing but contempt for any company that tries to use patents to achieve what they could not through purely competitive means. This includes Microsoft, should they ever choose to do so or have they ever chosen to do so. (I'm not aware of any such situation, but I'm hardly omniscient.)\r<br \/> <br \/>However, software patents do exist. So while the good fight goes on to get rid of them, I also believe that it would be dangerously naive to not play the game as best we can in the meantime in as principled a way as possible. There are a lot of people who would love nothing more than to just take a piece out of Microsoft either because they can or because they want to get rich and not for any better reason than that. I've been around long enough to see the kind of trouble that patents can cause us, and so I believe the best defense is a good offense. While I don't believe in using patents in an unprovoked way, I do believe in having a robust patent arsenal with which to defend ourselves should someone get it in their head that they want to hold our products hostage for money or just to cause trouble.<\/blockquote><\/span> <br \/>I reckon this is the strongest non evil argument in favor of software patents.

[via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lessig.org\/blog\/archives\/002291.shtml\">LessigBlog<\/a>]\r<br \/> <br \/>So if software patents are that bad that according to someone who has made real good money out of this business, they would have caused the now thriving industry to come to a standstill, is the world trying to end them? No, on the contrary US has them already, and EU is going for them.\r<br \/> <br \/>Below is my opinion on India and Intellectual Property Rights. \r<br \/><span class=\"fullpost\"> <br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\">Wired<\/a> has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/news\/politics\/0,1283,65704,00.html\">story<\/a> about a proposed US law that pretends to protect copyrights, but:<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><blockquote>under the proposed law, skipping any commercials or promotional announcements would be prohibited \"that would otherwise be performed or displayed before, during or after the performance of the motion picture\"<\/blockquote><\/span> <br \/>Would I be able to legally change channels when commercials start? well according to this law, No. My idea is not to find ironic humor, but to highlight the extent the boundary between legal and illegal is being laid down, (or atleast is being attepted to), by commercial interests. \r<br \/> <br \/>So why do I, an indian, keep harping about laws in US that may or may not be enforced even there? Well, CTBT never got signed by US, but required <a href=\"http:\/\/www.indianembassy.org\/policy\/CTBT\/ctbt_ghose.htm\">mammoth amount of resilience<\/a> by Indian leadership to thwart US attempts to enforce it on India. Would India be able to do it for all the laws US forces down our throat? [Such laws are always proposed thanks to heavy backing of corporate interests, only the very naive not knows the extent US govt. is and should be willing to use their diplomatic and militry influence to support its commercial interests]. The problem with these laws are they are very complicated (plus the fact that they require expertise in IP, IT and Law, to really understand the expressed and real motives behind them), and the relatively new and not very understood notion of (attempts of) making laws in order to do what should have been illegal. The importance of the role outsourcing is playing in improving the Indian economy, and the subsequent attempts by the Indian govt. to woo American companies by assuring them of intellectual property security scene in India, so that they can push even more work here; may also play a role towards making them (Indian lawmakers) have a blind eye towards such concerns. these are not unprecedented either, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ffii.org\">FFII<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/swpat.ffii.org\/\">says<\/a>: <span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><blockquote>For the last few years the European Patent Office (EPO) has, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">contrary to the letter<\/span> and spirit of the existing law, granted more than 30000 patents on rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of general-purpose computing equipment, called \"programs for computers\" in the law of 1973 and \"computer-implemented inventions\" in EPO Newspeak since 2000. Europe's patent movement is pressing to legitimate this practise by writing a new law.<\/blockquote><\/span> <br \/>Are such moves, supported by US corporates against EU's interests? They are having long debates about it. But if EU and US do find software patents and other restrictive IPR laws favourable to their interests, and they combined, try to enforce it on India, would India be able to oppose them? Would be very difficult for Indian lawmakers unless there is popular awareness towards the drawback against such intellectual protection regimes, of the kind was present in the case of India's nuclear stance. \r<br \/> <br \/>No I am not encouraging stealing, stealing is a crime, but not without a law that makes it so, and law is not God given, but is written by individual countries based on their interests. I am saying making stringent laws against \"IP stealing\" right now may not be in favor of India. Right now bole to? 10-15 years.\r<br \/><\/span><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"><\/div><\/p>",

I fear, however, that a narrow Democrat victory will not provide the necessary mandate to roll that repressive tendency back under the stone from which it emerged. I fear that the only way you - as a Nation - will exorcise that demon permanently is to let the religious right and its conservative supporters impose the kind of total control over society which appears to give them wet dreams. Then, when the next 9-11 happens and kills twice as many Americans despite the burgeoning Police State and despite the overarching alleged Security; only then will middle America understand that the repressive approach is just as disastrous as the complacency which allowed the first attack. Only then will they begin to understand that Security which impinges on Liberty is utterly self defeating. And only then will we see enough Americans remembering that they are supposed to be the \"Land of the Free\" and turning on their puppet masters to tear them limb from limb (metaphorically, of course).<\/span><\/blockquote> <br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neoconservatism_(United_States)\">NeoCons<\/a> have won. <a href=\"http:\/\/weblog.siliconvalley.com\/column\/dangillmor\/\">Dan Gillmore's eJournal<\/a> has another interesting <a href=\"http:\/\/weblog.siliconvalley.com\/column\/dangillmor\/archives\/010986.shtml#010986\">rant<\/a>.

In normal processors there usually is a clock that synchronizes all the components, so that for example, slave component, making available data to master, does not have to worry about how long to make it available far, so that the master has read it, and it can release the bus\/resource and powerdown. It does it for one (or n) clock period(s). <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/article.pl?sid=04\/11\/02\/0419248\">They say<\/a> the new idea is:\r<br \/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><blockquote>\"...to let the CPU's component blocks run at their own rate, synchronising with each other only when needed. Like a normal RISC processor, one instruction typically takes one clock cycle; but in a clockless ARM, a cycle can take less time for different classes of instructions.\r<br \/> <br \/>For example, a MOV instruction could finish before (and hence consume less power than) an ADD, even though they both execute in a single cycle. As well as energy-efficiency, running at effectively random frequencies reduces a chip's RFI emissions - handy if it's living in a cellphone or other wireless device.\" <\/blockquote><\/span> <br \/>Another disadvantage of the old method is: if the clock speed is fast enough for the maximum load condition, every component on the processor chip is running in that condition all the time, wasting a lot of power.

Its their money after all). And should we support the highly letigious culture in India? its a pandora's box, it will improve so many things, accountability, but it will increase the cost of so many things.
